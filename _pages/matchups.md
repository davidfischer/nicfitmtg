While many matchups vary considerably based on the specific [archetype]({% link _pages/archetypes.md %}) being played,
there are some commonalities shared by most Nic Fit variants.
At its heart, Nic Fit is a midrange deck that attempts to use {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}
to ramp to bigger threats than the oppponent.
Historically, the deck has favorable matchups against most aggro and other midrange decks
while having very tough matchups against most combo decks as well as some hard control decks
like Lands and Miracles.

Nic Fit pilots are always rewarded for knowing the matchup and metagame really well
especially with respect to what to name with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}.


## Aggro matchups

### Delver
Traditionally {% mtgcardlink Delver of Secrets // Insectile Aberration | Delver %} is a favorable matchup
for most Nic Fit variants. {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} is usually completely one-sided
and you can make cards like {% mtgcardlink Wasteland %} and {% mtgcardlink Daze %} useless for them.
While not as popular anymore, {% mtgcardlink Stifle %} is a key card to watch out for as it can be used
to boost their mana denial plan by either negating a fetchland or even countering Veteran Explorer's trigger.

You can still lose this matchup if your deck bricks or if they get a great fast Delver hand.
Sideboard in every anti-aggro card you have as well as {% mtgcardlink Carpet of Flowers %}
if you have it which can really negate their mana denial plan.

{% mtghand %}
Abrupt Decay
Swords to Plowshares
Plague Engineer
Ice-Fang Coatl
Carpet of Flowers
{% endmtghand %}

With {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}, you typically want to name a card that really beats your game plan.
On the play with a slower or a removal-light hand,
naming {% mtgcardlink Delver of Secrets // Insectile Aberration | Delver of Secrets %} is fine.
With a threat-light hand, you might want to name {% mtgcardlink Force of Will %} to make sure your haymakers stick.


### Maverick
Maverick is another matchup that is usually favorable.
The key card for them in this matchup is {% mtgcardlink Knight of the Reliquary %}
although they can really slow you down with {% mtgcardlink Thalia, Guardian of Thraben %}.
Knight is the only card they have that can stand toe to toe with Nic Fit sized threats.
Save removal for Knight and it's a good name for {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}.

You win this matchup by playing big threats they can't deal with
while you can lose either to a very fast Thalia start or by not fetching basics and getting
blown out by multiple {% mtgcardlink Wasteland | Wastelands %}.


### Death & Taxes
This is another favorable matchup although not as much as you might think depending on the Nic Fit variant.
{% mtgcardlink Plague Engineer %} and {% mtgcardlink Pernicious Deed %} are absolutely crushing.
You want to play around {% mtgcardlink Wasteland %} by aggressively fetching basics.
{% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %} can turn off their equipment
and {% mtgcardlink Knight of Autumn %}/{% mtgcardlink Reclamation Sage %} can destroy it.

Naming {% mtgcardlink Aether Vial %} on the play with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} is usually correct
and {% mtgcardlink Thalia, Guardian of Thraben %} or {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %} are great on the draw.

{% mtghand %}
Abrupt Decay
Plague Engineer
Pernicious Deed
Collector Ouphe
{% endmtghand %}

They can still win this matchup with a fast Thalia start coupled with {% mtgcardlink Rishadan Port %} or Wasteland
or they can sometimes get you with equipment and fliers like {% mtgcardlink Flickerwisp %}.


### Eldrazi Aggro
Eldrazi feels closer to even although still slightly Nic Fit favored depending on the variant.
{% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} is typically one-sided or close to it and the Vet
does a great {% mtgcardlink Moat %} impression by making the opponent think twice about attacking.
Sticking any threat bigger than a {% mtgcardlink Reality Smasher %} typically closes the door on them.

Eldrazi can still beat you with a very fast start
and you have to be cautious about keeping hands that rely on too many 1-drops on the draw
due to {% mtgcardlink Chalice of the Void %}.
{% mtgcardlink Thought-Knot Seer %} is almost always the right name with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}
although a case can be made for Reality Smasher depending on your hand.


### Burn
The Burn matchup (it's a "turn 3 combo deck" after all) can vary a lot depending on the variant.
You need to stick something that blocks {% mtgcardlink Goblin Guide %} and {% mtgcardlink Monastery Swiftspear %}
as fast as possible and they typically have to just attack into {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} which feels bad.
Hitting {% mtgcardlink Lightning Bolt %} or any other bolt effect with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} is great.

You want to prioritize any lifegain you have in your deck like {% mtgcardlink Scavenging Ooze %},
{% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %}, or {% mtgcardlink Huntmaster of the Fells // Ravager of the Fells %}.
This is one of the very few matchups that was better when [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}) ran {% mtgcardlink Siege Rhino %}.


### Dragon Stompy
Despite the number of basics in Nic Fit,
this has proven to be a slightly tough matchup since they put a lot of pressure on early.
What to name with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} depends heavily on what you have in your hand.
If you have multiple Therapies and/or {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %},
you might name {% mtgcardlink Chalice of the Void %} on the play.
With a hand full of fetchlands or other non-basics, you might name {% mtgcardlink Blood Moon %} or {% mtgcardlink Magus of the Moon %}.
If not, or if you're on the draw, name {% mtgcardlink Goblin Rabblemaster %}, {% mtgcardlink Chandra, Torch of Defiance %},
or probably the best is {% mtgcardlink Karn, the Great Creator %}.

In this matchup, you want to mulligan a little more aggressively than normal to have answers to their threats.
Being down a card is not a problem as their deck is typically all-in on two or at most three threats.


## Control matchups

### Grixis Control/Midrange
This matchup feels marginally favorable and is a matchup where you have to play for value.
Between {% mtgcardlink Baleful Strix %}, {% mtgcardlink Kolaghan's Command %}, and {% mtgcardlink Snapcaster Mage %},
they will be trying to 2 for 1 you as much as possible and you need to do the same while trying to play around theirs.

Destroying their graveyard is one of the keys to this matchup as it typically is where their 2 for 1s come from
so cards like {% mtgcardlink Scavenging Ooze %} in the mid-game are pretty important.
{% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} should win you the game in this matchup.


### Stoneblade
Stoneblade is normally a pretty favorable matchup as Nic Fit creatures typically outclass anything Stoneblade has to offer.
{% mtgcardlink Plague Engineer %} has helped immensely as another main deck way to deal with {% mtgcardlink True-Name Nemesis %}.
{% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %} is pretty good here and usually eats an immediate {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %}.

The hardest card to deal with in their deck is True-Name so naming that with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} is typically correct
although {% mtgcardlink Force of Will %} isn't bad either. Sometimes it is also correct to save a Therapy
to get whatever equipment they fetch off of {% mtgcardlink Stoneforge Mystic %}.


### Lands
Traditionally, Lands is a pretty difficult matchup as Nic Fit doesn't have many cards that interact with lands.
[Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}) gets {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %} which helps a lot
and [BUG Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/bug-fit.md %}) has access to blockers like {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %}
and can follow up by elking {% mtgcardlink Marit Lage %}.

Sideboard cards like {% mtgcardlink Unmoored Ego %} which unlike {% mtgcardlink Slaughter Games %} or {% mtgcardlink Lost Legacy %}
can hit {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %} or {% mtgcardlink Thespian's Stage %} is really good and can win the game.
Outside of the combo, their only real threat to you is {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}.
Without Stage, even Field isn't as much of a risk.

{% mtghand %}
Swords to Plowshares
Assassin's Trophy
Unmoored Ego
Surgical Extraction
{% endmtghand %}


### Loam
Compared with Lands, Loam is a bit easier.
{% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %} doesn't do as much against Nic Fit and the {% mtgcardlink Wasteland %} plan
just isn't that good against a deck running 6+ basics.

You can still lose this matchup on the draw to a turn 1 {% mtgcardlink Chalice of the Void %}
and {% mtgcardlink Knight of the Reliquary %} is no joke and should be removed immediately.
{% mtgcardlink Liliana of the Veil %} is also very good although our top decks are typically better than theirs.
This matchup is a bit tougher if they have a backup {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %} plan.


### Snow Control/Miracles
Before 2019, this matchup was almost unwinnable except for Nic Fit combo variants where Miracles was actually a pretty favorable pairing.
The printing of {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} has helped the matchup immensely and has helped cement
{% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} as the best finisher in Nic Fit.
The key to the matchup is to not overcommit to the board and try to make sure their sweepers are one for one.
Any planeswalkers you have also really shine here.
Sideboard out most of the {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer | Veteran Explorers %}
as they help the opponent as much if not more than you.

The matchup is still pretty tough and very grindy (unless it's combo Nic Fit).
Matches frequently end up at time so winning game 1 can be very important in paper
and be very careful about your time when playing online.
Card quantity is the key in the matchup and matters more than quality.

With {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}, you really want to hit {% mtgcardlink Force of Will %}
so you can stick a planeswalker, {% mtgcardlink Sylvan Library %}, or some big threat like {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %}.

{% mtghand %}
Primeval Titan
Field of the Dead
Phyrexian Tower
Volrath's Stronghold
Klothys, God of Destiny
{% endmtghand %}


## Combo matchups

### Show & Tell
Shred their hand if possible but this is one of the toughest matchups for Nic Fit.
We don't have a lot that interacts with their game plan.

In sideboarding, you should probably side out some number of {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}
as it ramps them directly to their win condition.
Discard and cards like {% mtgcardlink Slaughter Games %} are really good here.
UG Omnitell typically will side in {% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %} which makes Slaughter Games risky
but if you take {% mtgcardlink Show and Tell %}, the game is typically over.
Sneak & Show has a little redundancy against Slaughter Games because of {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %}
but they don't get Veil making discard even better. 

{% mtghand %}
Thoughtseize
Slaughter Games
Pyroblast
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} should basically always name {% mtgcardlink Show and Tell %}.
If possible, save a {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %} for
{% mtgcardlink Knight of Autumn %}/{% mtgcardlink Reclamation Sage %} in case they tap out for {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %}.


### Storm
Storm used to be an unwinnable matchup but it is now merely a tough one.
One of the biggest reasons for the matchup feeling better is the printing of the Null Rod on a stick {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %}.
In this matchup, the Ouphe is as good if not better than {% mtgcardlink Gaddock Teeg %}
and some Storm ANT variants can't beat an Ouphe game 1.
{% mtgcardlink Plague Engineer %} also gives some additional outs to {% mtgcardlink Empty the Warrens %}.

You typically want to name {% mtgcardlink Dark Ritual %} with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}
especially if you're trying to get an early Ouphe.

{% mtghand %}
Gaddock Teeg
Thoughtseize
Collector Ouphe
Slaughter Games
Plague Engineer
Deafening Silence
{% endmtghand %}


### Depths
Depths is another hard matchup as Nic Fit doesn't have much that interacts with lands.
{% mtgcardlink Plague Engineer %} naming vampire is not bad since it completely stops {% mtgcardlink Vampire Hexmage %}.
If you're on [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}),
{% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %} and {% mtgcardlink Karakas %} turn this matchup from dreadful to about even.
[BUG]({% link _pages/archetypes/bug-fit.md %}) should prioritize flying blockers and {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %}
as a solution to {% mtgcardlink Marit Lage %}.

From the sideboard, you want any {% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy | Assassin's Trophies %} you have
and if you're on [BUG]({% link _pages/archetypes/bug-fit.md %}), {% mtgcardlink Unmoored Ego %} is OK although a bit slow.
{% mtgcardlink Back to Basics %} can also help depending on the exact variant of Depths.

{% mtgcardlink Crop Rotation %} is one of the best cards to name with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}
although Vampire Hexmage isn't bad either. 


### Reanimator
This is an extremely tough matchup game 1 although it typically gets much better post-board.
Sometimes you can disrupt them enough with your discard spells
and you want to prioritize getting {% mtgcardlink Scavenging Ooze %} online as fast as possible.
Typically Ooze with mana open will shut the door completely on their game plan.
{% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} should hit one of their {% mtgcardlink Reanimate %} spells.

Post-board, you want all your graveyard hate and you should still prioritize Ooze.
Discard and cards like {% mtgcardlink Slaughter Games %} are also pretty good.
They almost never run enough lands to actually hard cast anything so Ooze with mana up should win the game.

{% mtghand %}
Scavenging Ooze
Leyline of the Void
Surgical Extraction
Faerie Macabre
{% endmtghand %}


### Dredge
This is a tough but very winnable matchup in game 1.
As with Reanimator prioritize getting {% mtgcardlink Scavenging Ooze %} to try to hold off their game plan.
Sacrifice creatures to get rid of {% mtgcardlink Bridge from Below %}.
For Manaless, {% mtgcardlink Gaddock Teeg %} shuts off almost all their spells although it doesn't turn off dredging.

There aren't a lot of good cards to name with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %},
but {% mtgcardlink Breakthrough %} is good on the play and {% mtgcardlink Narcomoeba %} is not totally worthless on the draw.
You typically still don't want to side out Therapy as it gives you a sac outlet to deal with Bridge from Below.


### Cloudpost
This matchup borders on unwinnable for most Nic Fit decks and is probably the absolute worst matchup.
Most Nic Fit decks have nothing that interacts quickly with {% mtgcardlink Cloudpost %}
and it's also one of the few decks where their threats are bigger.
BUG lists do frequently run {% mtgcardlink Back to Basics %} and this is a matchup
where {% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %}, while not great, can disrupt their game plan.
You can also win against Cloudpost decks by discarding their threats and pressuring the board.


### Elves
This is one of the few combo matchups that isn't completely awful although you need fast interaction or you're dead.
{% mtgcardlink Plague Engineer %} has helped this matchup a lot
and {% mtgcardlink Pernicious Deed %} is also a haymaker here although a turn slower.
If you're on BUG, sticking a {% mtgcardlink Leovold, Emissary of Trest %} can also negate a lot of their ability to come back.

Name {% mtgcardlink Natural Order %} with {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} as that is in their most explosive hands
although {% mtgcardlink Glimpse of Nature %} is also not bad.

{% mtghand %}
Plague Engineer
Pernicious Deed
Punishing Fire
{% endmtghand %}


### Infect
Infect is another combo matchup that doesn't feel that bad as you have a number of cards that interact with their game plan.
Make sure to use removal on your own turn to not get blown out by {% mtgcardlink Vines of Vastwood %}.
{% mtgcardlink Plague Engineer %} and {% mtgcardlink Pernicious Deed %} can lock down the game
and are also two of the best ways to interact with {% mtgcardlink Inkmoth Nexus %} (along with {% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %}).
They only run 12 total infecters so removal is very strong and you can profitably trade creature for creature with them.

With {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}, name {% mtgcardlink Invigorate %} if you're worried about an explosive start from them
although hitting {% mtgcardlink Blighted Agent %} isn't bad either.

{% mtghand %}
Assassin's Trophy
Plague Engineer
Pernicious Deed
Deafening Silence
{% endmtghand %}
