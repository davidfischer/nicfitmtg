Nic Fit is a fairly flexible deck and a number of different variations
on the core {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} / {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}
shell have shown to be viable from fair creature-based decks, to planeswalker heavy variants,
to outright combo decks.

Here, we break these different decks down into fair and combo decks
and detail some of the different strategies, strengths, and weaknesses of each deck.


## Established fair archetypes

### [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}) <i class="ms ms-g ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-b ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-w ms-cost"></i>
White adds a few good additions to the Nic Fit shell most notably {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %},
{% mtgcardlink Knight of Autumn %}, and {% mtgcardlink Karakas %} as well as considerably strengthening
the sideboard with cards like {% mtgcardlink Deafening Silence %}, {% mtgcardlink Ethersworn Canonist %},
and {% mtgcardlink Gaddock Teeg %}.
Historically, Junk has a pretty good aggro matchup and a little better combo matchup than most other variants.

### [BUG Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/bug-fit.md %}) <i class="ms ms-g ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-b ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-u ms-cost"></i>
Before 2019, the main reasons to splash blue in Nic Fit were {% mtgcardlink Leovold, Emissary of Trest %},
{% mtgcardlink Baleful Strix %} and maybe you could make a case for {% mtgcardlink Glen Elendra Archmage %}.
However, with the printing of {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %} and {% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %},
BUG has turned into one of the best fair archetypes.

### [Jund Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/jund-fit.md %}) <i class="ms ms-g ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-b ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-r ms-cost"></i>
Some of the main cards that splashing red adds are
{% mtgcardlink Huntmaster of the Fells // Ravager of the Fells | Huntmaster of the Fells %} and {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %}
in addition to improving sideboards with cards like {% mtgcardlink Pyroblast %}.
Jund has one of the best aggro matchups due to the addition of Punishing Fire
and the deck can grind out a win in a lot of situations that would be tough for other variants.


## Established combo archetypes

### [Rectors]({% link _pages/archetypes/rectors.md %}) <i class="ms ms-g ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-b ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-w ms-cost"></i>
Rector variants try to use {% mtgcardlink Academy Rector %} and/or {% mtgcardlink Arena Rector %}
to power out huge enchantments or planeswalkers that do all but win the game on the spot.
The ramp provided by {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} and the sac outlet from {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}
help the deck power out the combo.

### [Sneak Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/sneak-fit.md %}) <i class="ms ms-g ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-b ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-r ms-cost"></i>
Sneak Fit marries a mostly fair Jund Fit plan but also contains {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %}
to cheat big threats including {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn %} into play.
Other big threats typically include {% mtgcardlink Inferno Titan %} and {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %}
which coupled with {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} puts in double duty as a {% mtgcardlink Grave Titan %}.
The deck has probably the best Miracles matchup of all Nic Fit variants,
however it also has one of the most vulnerable manabases.

### [Scapewish]({% link _pages/archetypes/scapewish.md %}) <i class="ms ms-g ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-b ms-cost"></i><i class="ms ms-r ms-cost"></i> 
Scapewish is a Legacy take on the Modern {% mtgcardlink Scapeshift %} deck
that uses Scapeshift and {% mtgcardlink Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle %}
to attempt to win on the spot when the deck has 7 or 8 lands in play.
With Nic Fit, that comes quite a bit earlier because of {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}.
The wish part of the name comes from 3-4 {% mtgcardlink Burning Wish | Burning Wishes %}
which provides a wishboard of a redundant Scapeshift and other great cards.
The deck has a better matchup against control than many Nic Fit variants
although it's a little more vulnerable to aggro plans.


## Fringe archetypes

### Yawg Fit
When {% mtgcardlink Yawgmoth, Thran Physician %} was first spoiled,
Nic Fit brewers immediately started testing the card.
It was tried as just a 2-3 of in fair value oriented decks as well as in combos
with cards like {% mtgcardlink Saffi Eriksdotter %} and {% mtgcardlink Renegade Rallier %}
but nothing showed a lot of success over proven archetypes.

Pleasant Kenobi piloted [Yawg Fit](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/511285502) in an elimination match
for Season 4 of the Legacy Premiere League.

### Pod Fit
A few intrepid pilots have tried to make {% mtgcardlink Birthing Pod %} work
as it has good synergy with {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}.
With the printing of {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %}, this deck is definitely relegated to the fringe
despite being a blast to play.
