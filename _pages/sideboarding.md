It's very challenging to write a single side guide for a deck
where the exact deck differs as much as Nic Fit [archetypes]({% link _pages/archetypes.md %}) do.
Rather than give an exact sideboarding strategy,
this guide will deal with various cards you might want in your sideboard
and you can decide what is appropriate for your exact deck with your local meta.

## Aggro Hate

{% mtghand %}
Plague Engineer
Pernicious Deed
Swords to Plowshares
{% endmtghand %}

Against most aggro decks, {% mtgcardlink Plague Engineer %} and {% mtgcardlink Pernicious Deed %}
fill a very similar role of wiping the board so the Nic Fit deck can stabilize
and typically 1-3 of these appear in most Nic Fit main decks,
but an additional 2 or so copies may appear in the sideboard.

In [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}), there are frequently additional copies of {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %}.
Even though Nic Fit generally gives the opponent basics, Swords is still typically preferred over {% mtgcardlink Path to Exile %}
because ramping the opponent on turns 1-3 can still be very important.
The exception to this is in decks also running Assassin's Trophy in the main deck.
In that case, the opponent is probably going to run out of basics very quickly.


## Combo Hate

{% mtghand %}
Collector Ouphe
Gaddock Teeg
Deafening Silence
Lost Legacy
Thoughtseize
Mindbreak Trap
{% endmtghand %}

Combo is one of the weakest matchups for Nic Fit so it isn't surprising that a lot of the sideboard is dedicated against it.
Before the printing of {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %}, matchups like Storm were completely unwinnable game 1 without {% mtgcardlink Gaddock Teeg %}.
Ouphe is one of the best anti-combo cards and gives Nic Fit a game in a lot of matchups like Urza/Emry, Karn matchups, and even Storm
by shutting off {% mtgcardlink Lion's Eye Diamond %}, {% mtgcardlink Lotus Petal %}, and {% mtgcardlink Wishclaw Talisman %}.
Ouphe has earned a spot in most main decks as a singleton but functionally it has 5 copies due to {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %}.

Because Nic Fit uses mana acceleration, {% mtgcardlink Lost Legacy %} effects such as {% mtgcardlink Slaughter Games %}
and {% mtgcardlink Unmoored Ego %} can work well out of the sideboard against combo.
Before the printing of {% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %}, Slaughter Games was the undisputed best of these
but now even that can be "countered".
Unmoored Ego has the added advantage of being able to name {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %} or {% mtgcardlink Thespian's Stage %}.

[Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}) adds some great additional anti-combo cards in
{% mtgcardlink Gaddock Teeg %}, {% mtgcardlink Deafening Silence %}, and {% mtgcardlink Ethersworn Canonist %}.
Deafening Silence is very hard for decks like Storm to deal with and can result in them being locked out turn 1.
It also works well against Infect by preventing them from using multiple pump spells and making sure your removal is good after they use one.

In [BUG Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}), {% mtgcardlink Mindbreak Trap %} doubles as a very nice piece of combo hate
and can be easily hard cast due to the ramp in the deck.

## Graveyard Hate

{% mtghand %}
Scavenging Ooze
Leyline of the Void
Surgical Extraction
Faerie Macabre
{% endmtghand %}

Nic Fit decks are typically a bit soft to graveyard decks and especially Reanimator
and they usually dedicate 3-6 sideboard cards to graveyard decks.

Almost all Nic Fit archetypes run {% mtgcardlink Scavenging Ooze %} in the main deck
and if it isn't in the main, it is definitely in the sideboard.
With {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %}, Nic Fit is effectively running 5 copies.
Scooze can singlehandedly lock a deck like Reanimator or Dredge out of the game
if they stumble at all and it's still a great card even if the opponent isn't on a graveyard deck.

After Scooze, most Nic Fit decks run some number of {% mtgcardlink Leyline of the Void %}
and/or {% mtgcardlink Surgical Extraction %} in the sideboard as well.
Surgical is a bit better against decks with a few very important cards like Lands
while Leyline is better against decks with more varried threats like Hogaak and Dredge.

{% mtgcardlink Faerie Macabre %} is worth a brief mention even though it is typically considered worse
than Leyline or Surgical because it has synergy with
{% mtgcardlink Volrath's Stronghold %} and {% mtgcardlink Meren of Clan Nel Toth %} both of which
frequently appear in Nic Fit lists.

## Blue Hate

{% mtghand %}
Veil of Summer
Carpet of Flowers
Choke
Pyroblast
{% endmtghand %}

Blue decks and especially Miracles are the bane of Nic Fit and Nic Fit typically dedicates between 3-4 cards to hating blue decks.
Between {% mtgcardlink Carpet of Flowers %} and {% mtgcardlink Choke %}, most Nic Fit variants favor Carpet
as mana denial isn't really in the Nic Fit plan.
Against basic-heavy blue decks like Miracles, Snow Control, and Stoneblade, Nic Fit pilots typically side out
some of the {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer | Veteran Explorers %} for Carpets to get one-sided ramp.
Against Delver decks, Carpet is an additional source of ramp on top of Veteran Explorer to make sure their mana denial plan doesn't work.

Combo variants of Nic Fit like [Rectors]({% link _pages/archetypes/rectors.md %})
and [Scapewish]({% link _pages/archetypes/scapewish.md %}) typically run some number of {% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %}
to make sure the combo resolves.

## Catch-all Cards

{% mtghand %}
Assassin's Trophy
Force of Vigor
{% endmtghand %}

There's a few cards that are good in a number of matchups that aren't strictly "hate" cards.
{% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %} can work against aggro decks, decks relying on planeswalkers,
or they can clear out opposing Leylines or things that hinder your plan.

{% mtgcardlink Force of Vigor %} works against many combo variants and it can result in huge blowouts
against {% mtgcardlink Chalice of the Void | Chalice %} decks.
