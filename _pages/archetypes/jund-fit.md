Jund Fit is a fair Green-Black-Red Nic Fit variant.
The exact deck can differ a bit but usually Jund packs a heavy control plan
and leans on cards like {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %}.
Unlike the Jund combo variants of Nic Fit like [Scapewish]({% link _pages/archetypes/scapewish.md %})
and [Sneak Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/sneak-fit.md %}),
this deck has a fair game plan and tries to grind out wins with value cards like
{% mtgcardlink Huntmaster of the Fells // Ravager of the Fells | Huntmaster of the Fells %}
in addition to the usual band of Nic Fit threats like {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} or {% mtgcardlink Titania, Protector of Argoth %}.

{% mtghand %}
Punishing Fire
Huntmaster of the Fells // Ravager of the Fells
Klothys, God of Destiny
Kolaghan's Command
Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger

There's a few different directions Jund Fit can go and this deck is a less all-in version of Titan Dryad.
It relies on ramp to get to {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} which can end the game pretty quickly with {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}
or with {% mtgcardlink Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle %} and {% mtgcardlink Dryad of the Ilysian Grove %}.
Unlike Titan Dryad which relies on disruption in the form of {% mtgcardlink Chalice of the Void %} and {% mtgcardlink Wasteland %},
this deck relies more on {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} and {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %}.

Before the printing of {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %},
some cards like {% mtgcardlink Dragonlord Atarka %}, {% mtgcardlink Ravager Wurm %},
or even {% mtgcardlink Ruric Thar, the Unbowed %} were contenders for the top-end threat in Jund.
They are all huge threats that take over the game and have unique abilities not usually available in green-black alone.
However, since Field, {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} is just too good to pass up.


## Jund Fit's place in the meta

The addition of {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %} to the core Nic Fit shell
gives a big boost to the removal package and as a result the deck has a fantastic matchup
against most aggressive decks like Death & Taxes, Maverick, Goblins, and Delver.
While aggro decks usually aren't the weakness of Nic Fit, red makes the matchups that much better.

One aggro deck that Jund doesn't have as good a matchup against is Eldrazi.
Eldrazi creatures come out quickly, mostly aren't vulnerable to Punishing Fire,
and outclass many of the threats in the deck.
The matchup feels closer to 50-50 although having cards like {% mtgcardlink Tireless Tracker %}
or {% mtgcardlink Tarmogoyf %} can improve that number.
Sideboard cards like {% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %} help here as well.

Jund has a decent matchup against control decks like BUG or Grixis Midrange, Miracles, and Snow Control,
although it really hinges on the exact list. The addition in 2020 of {% mtgcardlink Klothys, God of Destiny %}
has improved these matchups. It turns {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %} with X=3 into a must counter spell
since most decks don't have much to interact with Klothys especially with {% mtgcardlink Council's Judgment %} out of fashion.
Most control decks struggle to race an early Klothys and Klothys disrupts their game plan of {% mtgcardlink Snapcaster Mage %} and
{% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %} while providing some amount of inevitability.
If the Jund player is also playing {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}, the matchups feel pretty good.

Where Jund really struggles is against combo decks including {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %} decks,
Storm, and Show and Tell. Post sideboard, {% mtgcardlink Pyroblast %} gives the deck lots of ways to disrupt Show and Tell
although the matchup is still unfavorable.
Depths matchups are very tough as Jund lacks the kind of spot removal needed to kill {% mtgcardlink Marit Lage %}
that are available in different colors like {% mtgcardlink Tyrant's Scorn %} or {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %}.
All the additional removal, however, does help Jund against Elves and Infect and the latter is probably a favorable matchup.

The addition in 2019 of {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %} helped Jund immensely against a few different combo decks
like Storm and Bomberman. Before the Ouphe, those were borderline unwinnable. They are still unfavorable pairings,
but they can be won. As a result, Ouphe is very frequently a main deck card in Jund Nic Fit lists.

On the whole, Jund Fit thrives in a combo-light environment and has very good matchups against aggro
and decent matchups against most control decks
but the combo matchups are even worse than other Nic Fit variants.
As a result, as of this writing in mid-2020, Jund is among the weaker Nic Fit archetypes
at least in the MTGO metagame due to the ubiquity of combo and control
and the relative weakness in the meta of the decks that Jund would prey on like Death & Taxes.
{% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %} is at its weakest point in a long time and that is not good for this deck.


## Sideboarding

{% mtghand %}
Pyroblast
Red Elemental Blast
Slaughter Games
Cindervines
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Red Elemental Blast %} and {% mtgcardlink Pyroblast %} are among the best sideboard cards in the format.
They provide a clean one for one answer to {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %} for a single mana and they're good
in a large variety of combo and fair matchups.
By itself, it drastically changes the percentages in the {% mtgcardlink Show and Tell %} matchup
which is normally almost unwinnable for fair Nic Fit decks
while also helping against combo decks like Painter, Storm, and {% mtgcardlink Doomsday %}.
On the fair side, it's great against Miracles, Snow Control, and even Delver.
Overall this should be a staple of any fair Jund deck's sideboard and playing any less than 2 doesn't seem right.

{% mtgcardlink Slaughter Games %} used to be a regular sideboard card of both combo and fair Jund Nic Fit decks.
Against both Storm and Miracles, it was possible to remove most of their win conditions with a single cast
and casting it a second time off {% mtgcardlink Eternal Witness %} was usually game ending.
The printing of {% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %} has changed that and significantly weakened Slaughter Games.
It's no longer the uncounterable spell it once was. With many Storm decks running Veil in the main deck
and Snow Control running it out of the sideboard, Slaughter Games simply isn't as good anymore.
It's still decent but no longer the automatic sideboard card it was in past years.

Instead of Slaughter Games, {% mtgcardlink Cindervines %} has provided an an alternate angle of attack
against the Snow Control, Miracles, and Storm decks by "taxing" them for one damage per spell.
Enchantments are pretty hard to deal with for those decks and the single damage from Cindervines really adds up in both matchups.
Against Storm, it usually turns off {% mtgcardlink Ad Nauseam %} lines
and against Snow or Miracles it combined with {% mtgcardlink Klothys, God of Destiny %} can end the game while being
very hard for those decks to deal with.
It's also a serviceable sideboard card against artifact or equipment heavy decks.

Having access to {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %} on top of the usual Nic Fit removal like {% mtgcardlink Abrupt Decay %}
makes the deck pretty good against creature-based strategies.
However, unlike both [BUG Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/bug-fit.md %}) and [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}),
the deck frequently doesn't have as many ways to deal with {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %} strategies.
Depending on how common Depths is in your meta, you might consider sideboard cards like
{% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %}, {% mtgcardlink Liliana's Triumph %}, or even {% mtgcardlink Matsu-Tribe Sniper %} as answers.

Like most decks that don't have a lot of counter magic, Jund Fit is soft to fast combo decks like Reanimator,
Turbo Depths, Storm, and Show & Tell. It is no surprise that most of the Jund Fit sideboard is dedicated to these matchups.
Jund Fit usually packs 4-6 grave hate cards with {% mtgcardlink Leyline of the Void %} or {% mtgcardlink Surgical Extraction %} being most common,
4 or so anti-combo cards ({% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %} or {% mtgcardlink Cindervines %})
with anti-blue cards rounding out the rest.


## Conclusion

Jund Fit is in a bit of a tough spot right now in MTGO leagues
but could be the right call in a local meta with a lot of aggressive decks.
If and when aggressive decks represent a larger share of the metagame and {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %} feels like an amazing card again,
Jund Fit will come back as well.
