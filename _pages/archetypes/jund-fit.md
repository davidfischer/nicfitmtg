Jund Fit is a fair Green-Black-Red Nic Fit variant.
The exact deck can differ a bit but usually Jund packs a heavy control plan
and leans on cards like {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %}.
Unlike the Jund combo variants of Nic Fit like [Scapewish]({% link _pages/archetypes/scapewish.md %})
and [Sneak Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/sneak-fit.md %}),
this deck has a fair game plan and tries to grind out wins with value cards like
{% mtgcardlink Huntmaster of the Fells // Ravager of the Fells | Huntmaster of the Fells %}
in addition to the usual band of Nic Fit threats like {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} or {% mtgcardlink Titania, Protector of Argoth %}.

{% mtghand %}
Punishing Fire
Huntmaster of the Fells // Ravager of the Fells
Klothys, God of Destiny
Kolaghan's Command
Greater Gargadon
{% endmtghand %}

{% endmtgdeck %}


There's a few different directions Jund Fit can go and this deck uses a control plan to survive
until it can cast {% mtgcardlink Titania, Protector of Argoth %} or {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %}
both of which end the game pretty quickly.
{% mtgcardlink Greater Gargadon %} has proven to be highly effective as an uncounterable
sac outlet for {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}, but it really shines with Titania
where it threatens to put 20-30 power on the board in a single turn by sacrificing our lands.

{% mtgcardlink Once Upon a Time %} is not a staple of most fair variants but it works well in this deck
as a way to ensure you find an early Explorer or Gargadon.
In the later game, it acts similarly to a cantrip and can hopefully find a mid- or late-game threat.


## Jund Fit's place in the meta

The addition of {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %} to the core Nic Fit shell
gives a big boost to the removal package and as a result the deck has a fantastic matchup
against most aggressive decks like Death & Taxes, Maverick, Goblins, and a decent Delver matchup.
While aggro decks usually aren't the weakness of Nic Fit, red makes the matchups that much better.

One aggro deck that Jund doesn't have as good a matchup against is Eldrazi.
Eldrazi creatures come out quickly, mostly aren't vulnerable to Punishing Fire,
and outclass many of the threats in the deck.
The matchup feels closer to 50-50 although having cards like {% mtgcardlink Tireless Tracker %}
or {% mtgcardlink Tarmogoyf %} can improve that number.
Sideboard cards like {% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %} help here as well.

Jund has a decent matchup against control decks like BUG or Grixis Midrange, Miracles, and Snow Control,
although it really hinges on the exact list. The addition in 2020 of {% mtgcardlink Klothys, God of Destiny %}
has improved these matchups. It turns {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %} with X=3 into a must counter spell
since most decks don't have much to interact with Klothys especially with {% mtgcardlink Council's Judgment %} out of fashion.
Most control decks struggle to race an early Klothys and Klothys disrupts their game plan of {% mtgcardlink Snapcaster Mage %} and
{% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %} while providing some amount of inevitability.
If the Jund player is also playing {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}, the matchups feel pretty good.

Where Jund really struggles is against combo decks including {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %} decks,
Storm, and Show and Tell. Post sideboard, {% mtgcardlink Pyroblast %} gives the deck lots of ways to disrupt Show and Tell
although the matchup is still unfavorable.
Depths matchups are very tough as Jund lacks the kind of spot removal needed to kill {% mtgcardlink Marit Lage %}
that are available in different colors like {% mtgcardlink Tyrant's Scorn %} or {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %}.
All the additional removal, however, does help Jund against Elves and Infect and the latter is probably a favorable matchup.

The addition in 2019 of {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %} helped Jund immensely against a few different combo decks
like Storm and Bomberman. Before the Ouphe, those were borderline unwinnable. They are still unfavorable pairings,
but they can be won. As a result, Ouphe is very frequently a main deck card in Jund Nic Fit lists.

On the whole, Jund Fit thrives in a combo-light environment and has very good matchups against aggro
and decent matchups against most control decks
but the combo matchups can be worse than other Nic Fit variants.


## Sideboarding

{% mtghand %}
Pyroblast
Red Elemental Blast
Slaughter Games
Cindervines
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Red Elemental Blast %} and {% mtgcardlink Pyroblast %} are among the best sideboard cards in the format.
They're good in a large variety of combo and fair matchups.
By themselves, they drastically changes the percentages in the {% mtgcardlink Show and Tell %} matchup
which is normally almost unwinnable for fair Nic Fit decks
while also helping against combo decks like Painter, Storm, and {% mtgcardlink Doomsday %}.
On the fair side, it's great against Miracles, Snow Control, and even Delver.
Overall this should be a staple of any fair Jund deck's sideboard and playing any less than 2 doesn't seem right.

{% mtgcardlink Slaughter Games %} used to be a regular sideboard card of both combo and fair Jund Nic Fit decks.
Against both Storm and Miracles, it was possible to remove most of their win conditions with a single cast
and casting it a second time off {% mtgcardlink Eternal Witness %} was usually game ending.
The printing of {% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %} has changed that and significantly weakened Slaughter Games.
It's no longer the uncounterable spell it once was. With many Storm decks running Veil in the main deck
and Snow Control running it out of the sideboard, Slaughter Games simply isn't as good anymore.
It's still decent but no longer the automatic sideboard card it was in past years.

Instead of Slaughter Games, {% mtgcardlink Cindervines %} has provided an an alternate angle of attack
against the Snow Control, Miracles, and Storm decks by "taxing" them for one damage per spell.
Enchantments are pretty hard to deal with for those decks and the single damage from Cindervines really adds up in both matchups.
Against Storm, it usually turns off {% mtgcardlink Ad Nauseam %} lines
and against Snow or Miracles it combined with {% mtgcardlink Klothys, God of Destiny %} can end the game while being
very hard for those decks to deal with.
It's also a serviceable sideboard card against artifact or equipment heavy decks.
{% mtgcardlink Necromentia %} is similar to Slaughter Games but can also take key lands like {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %} or {% mtgcardlink Thespian's Stage %} and so it's worth considering.

Having access to {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %} on top of the usual Nic Fit removal like {% mtgcardlink Abrupt Decay %}
makes the deck pretty good against creature-based strategies.
However, unlike both [BUG Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/bug-fit.md %}) and [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}),
the deck frequently doesn't have as many ways to deal with {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %} strategies.
Depending on how common Depths is in your meta, you might consider sideboard cards like
{% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %}, {% mtgcardlink Sudden Edict %}, or even {% mtgcardlink Run Afoul %} as answers.

Like most decks that don't have a lot of counter magic, Jund Fit is soft to fast combo decks like Reanimator,
Turbo Depths, Storm, and Show & Tell. It is no surprise that most of the Jund Fit sideboard is dedicated to these matchups.
Jund Fit usually packs 4-6 grave hate cards with {% mtgcardlink Leyline of the Void %}, {% mtgcardlink Surgical Extraction %}, or the new {% mtgcardlink Endurance %} being most common,
4 or so anti-combo cards ({% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %} or {% mtgcardlink Cindervines %})
with anti-blue cards rounding out the rest.


## Variations

### Applejacks

{% mtghand %}
Orcish Lumberjack
Titania, Protector of Argoth
Ramunap Excavator
{% endmtghand %}

Applejacks uses {% mtgcardlink Orcish Lumberjack %} to power out big threats in the very early game.
The ideal threat is {% mtgcardlink Titania, Protector of Argoth %} who can usually put 10-15 power on the board as early as turn two.
Applejacks isn't strictly a Nic Fit variant because it does not always rely on {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} and {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}.
However, this primer on Jund Fit would be incomplete without at least a mention of Applejacks.

Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle
Scapeshift

to get to seven or more lands to win with the combo of {% mtgcardlink Scapeshift %} into {% mtgcardlink Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle %}.
There's also a [separate primer]({% link _pages/archetypes/scapewish.md %}) for this deck.


## Conclusion

Jund Fit was in a bit of a tough spot during the Oko meta
but it's a fine call in a meta of aggressive decks.
