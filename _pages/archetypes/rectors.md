Rectors (variously called Rector Fit, Nyx Fit, or 8 Rector) is a combo Green-Black-White Nic Fit deck
that uses {% mtgcardlink Academy Rector %} and/or {% mtgcardlink Arena Rector %}
to find game winning threats and lock pieces.
The deck can vary from being all-in on the combo to just having Rectors as a backup plan.
Either way, the idea is that a single Rector trigger should find something like {% mtgcardlink Ugin, the Spirit Dragon %}
or {% mtgcardlink Overwhelming Splendor %} that can all but win the game on its own.

The two Rectors fit nicely with the usual Nic Fit game plan because any deck with {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}
will have multiple ways to put Rectors into the graveyard.
The disruption and sac outlet from {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} works perfectly to clear any grave hate cards
like {% mtgcardlink Surgical Extraction %} before going for the combo.
The ramp provided by Vet gets to the combo faster and can allow many of the threats and lock pieces to be hard cast if the game goes long.
This is a deck that typically looks like it's behind until it wins out of nowhere.

{% endmtgdeck %}

Congrats to Threpio on their 5-0 with a deck that hadn't been on many people's radars recently.
The 4 main deck {% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %} seems like a very strong statement in the current meta game.
A little light counter magic is not going to stop this deck.
Trepio's list is fairly all-in on the combo running the full 8 Rectors.

This deck list is packing an interesting {% mtgcardlink Living Wish | Living Wishboard %}.
It stashes both an {% mtgcardlink Academy Rector %} and an {% mtgcardlink Arena Rector %}
that can be fetched on demand to assemble the combo but safely away from any {% mtgcardlink Surgical Extraction %} effects.
{% mtgcardlink Phyrexian Tower %} is another piece of the combo and {% mtgcardlink Cavern of Souls %} is there to make sure it goes off through counter magic.
{% mtgcardlink Ancient Tomb %} can accelerate the combo and {% mtgcardlink Knight of Autumn %} answers one of the best ways to shut down the deck in
{% mtgcardlink Leyline of the Void %}.
If {% mtgcardlink Omniscience %} is in play, {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn %} typically ends the game when wished for.

The deck is also interesting for what it doesn't have.
There's no {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %} in this deck which is a staple of Nic Fit.
Instead, Threpio went with {% mtgcardlink Once Upon a Time %} which can also find Rectors.
{% mtgcardlink Village Rites %} is also not present and it had just became legal at the time of this league.
The other big noticeable omission is {% mtgcardlink Evolutionary Leap %} which is in many Rector decks
as a combination sac outlet and a way to find Rectors.
Between Once and the full 4 wishes, Threpio believes they have enough ways to assemble the combo.

Rector decks frequently need a way to use the huge threats and lock pieces that get stuck in the pilot's hand rather than those just being dead cards.
The deck has no way to cast {% mtgcardlink Omniscience %} for example.
Threpio's solution is {% mtgcardlink Eureka %} which is one of the best ways to dump a hand full of overcosted planeswalkers and enchantments.
Eureka does come with a hefty price tag in paper that might be a barrier to playing this in the real world,
but they are cheap and plentiful on MTGO.
Other past alternatives Rector pilots have used are {% mtgcardlink Collective Brutality %} and {% mtgcardlink Liliana of the Veil %}
but Eureka is probably one of the better alternatives.


## Threats and lock pieces


### Academy Rector targets

{% mtghand %}
Overwhelming Splendor
Cruel Reality
Dovescape
Ethereal Absolution
Sandwurm Convergence
Omniscience
{% endmtghand %}


##### Overwhelming Splendor
{% mtgcardlink Overwhelming Splendor %} is one of the main lock pieces in the deck. This card is game winning by itself against a bunch of decks like Depths where it turns {% mtgcardlink Marit Lage %} into a 1/1 while also turning off {% mtgcardlink Wasteland %}, Fetchlands, and {% mtgcardlink Thespian's Stage %}. Unless their board position is already formidable, most aggro decks will struggle to win by beating down with 1/1s. The answers to it pre-sideboard are relatively few across all of Legacy with cards like {% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %}, {% mtgcardlink Council's Judgment %}, and {% mtgcardlink Brazen Borrower // Petty Theft | Brazen Borrower %} (or Petty Theft more precisely) being the main ones. While this card won't end the game by itself, it buys ages of time to find an actual wincon.

##### Cruel Reality
{% mtgcardlink Cruel Reality %} doubles as a win condition and a lock piece and is almost impossible to beat for a deck that doesn't go wide with creatures. It's great against Delver, Depths, and even control and midrange decks like Snow and Miracles. Even though {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %} is better against it than most other planeswalkers, it will still finish the hat robber himself even if it might take a few turns depending on the board state.
This card was bugged on MTGO as of the M21 release which is why some lists haven't been running it.
When working, this is a must in any {% mtgcardlink Academy Rector %} list.

##### Ethereal Absolution
Both {% mtgcardlink Ethereal Absolution %} and its curse cousin {% mtgcardlink Curse of Death's Hold %}
destroy go-wide strategies and they combine with other lock pieces like {% mtgcardlink Dovescape %} or {% mtgcardlink Overwhelming Splendor %}
to produce near unbeatable board states.
Ethereal Absolution costs one more but doesn't target when hard cast, and its activated ability can be very relevant
especially when combined with {% mtgcardlink Evolutionary Leap %}. It is usually preferred unless going for the Curse variant (see below).

##### Dovescape
While not completely game ending by itself, {% mtgcardlink Dovescape %} can completely change the opponent's game plan.
It shuts down decks like Burn, Storm, and most control and midrange decks.
Just be careful because the opponent can still cast cards like {% mtgcardlink Force of Will %} to put 5 power onto the board.
When combined with {% mtgcardlink Ethereal Absolution %}, it presents a near unbeatable lock for many control and combo decks.

##### Sandwurm Convergence
Unlike most of the cards above, {% mtgcardlink Sandwurm Convergence %} is not always included in every Rector deck list.
It is fairly game ending against most aggro decks and decks featuring {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %}.
and can be compared in many ways to {% mtgcardlink Cruel Reality %}.
Sandwurm Convergence is a little better against wider board states and completely stops flying creatures like Marit Lage in their tracks.

##### Omniscience
{% mtgcardlink Omniscience %} allows the Rector player to cast any threats that became stranded in their hand
and it frequently wins on the spot with a {% mtgcardlink Living Wish %} for {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn %}.


### Arena Rector targets

{% mtghand %}
Ugin, the Spirit Dragon
Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker
Nicol Bolas, God-Pharaoh
Karn Liberated
{% endmtghand %}


##### Ugin, the Spirit Dragon
{% mtgcardlink Ugin, the Spirit Dragon %} is the preferred planeswalker to fetch with {% mtgcardlink Arena Rector %}
as it obliterates most board states and will win the game on its own.
Without a few very explicit cards, most decks have no way to deal with it at all
and it will win a lot of matchups including most creature decks and many control decks on its own.
Many Rector lists run two Ugins so there's almost always one in the library to find.

##### Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker & Nicol Bolas, God-Pharaoh
The Bolases are not always included in every list and they suffer from being not castable without {% mtgcardlink Omniscience %},
{% mtgcardlink Eureka %} (which technically isn't casting), or the odd list with {% mtgcardlink Oath of Nissa %}.
While both of them will quickly bury the opponent in card advantage, they are frequently worse than Ugin
except in some specific circumstances.
{% mtgcardlink Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker %} is good against pretty empty board states where it can go after the opponent's lands
or where the opponent has one big threat which can be destroyed or controlled.
{% mtgcardlink Nicol Bolas, God-Pharaoh %} is excellent at destroying an opponents hand and burying them in card advantage
while also protecting itself from a single threat that gets through.


##### Honorable mentions
There are a few other planeswalkers that might be included in the deck but are very rarely found with {% mtgcardlink Arena Rector %}
since there are typically better options:

* {% mtgcardlink Vraska, Golgari Queen %} is very hard castable and provides a sac outlet to get the combo started
* {% mtgcardlink Gideon of the Trials %} is an out to many storm decks and might be in a sideboard
* {% mtgcardlink Liliana of the Veil %} can deal with uncastable threats in the pilots hand while also being a sac outlet in a pinch
* {% mtgcardlink Liliana, Dreadhorde General %} is another sac outlet that can also end the game on its own


## Variations

### Curses

{% mtghand %}
Curse of Misfortunes
Curse of Death's Hold
Curse of Exhaustion
{% endmtghand %}

The curse variant has an alternative method of attack which is to get {% mtgcardlink Curse of Misfortunes %}
attached to the opponent which can then get one of many good curses
including both {% mtgcardlink Cruel Reality %} and {% mtgcardlink Overwhelming Splendor %}.
Sometimes this variant does not run {% mtgcardlink Arena Rector %} and focuses only on enchantments.


### Nyx Fit

{% mtghand %}
Starfield of Nyx
{% endmtghand %}

The term Nyx Fit is sometimes applied to any {% mtgcardlink Academy Rector %} Nic Fit deck,
but it originated from the card {% mtgcardlink Starfield of Nyx %} which was in earlier builds of the deck.
Starfield provides another way to end the game and when combined with {% mtgcardlink Collective Brutality %} or {% mtgcardlink Liliana of the Veil %},
big enchantments stranded in hand can be put into the graveyard where they can be retrieved to play.
However, actually running Starfield is out of fashion as of mid-2020.


### Yorion

{% mtghand %}
Yorion, Sky Nomad
{% endmtghand %}

Since the printing of {% mtgcardlink Yorion, Sky Nomad %}, a few brewers have thought to try to make Yorion work in Rectors
either in Abzan colors or by going to four colors and adding blue for {% mtgcardlink Baleful Strix %}, {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %},
{% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %}, and {% mtgcardlink Arcum's Astrolabe %}.
Going to 80 (or more) cards has the advantage of not drawing uncastable cards as often while still having them in the deck
when they're searched for. However, it dilutes the main Rector plan and slows down the combo.


### Fair-ish variants
One other variation is to appear like a relatively normal [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}) deck in terms of having a fair plan
while having one of the Rectors -- most commonly {% mtgcardlink Arena Rector %} -- as a backup plan.
Adding just a few Rectors and a few big threats to find with them has the advantage of not having too many uncastable cards.


## Wrapup
Rectors is a great Nic Fit combo deck that has had a reasonable amount of success lately.
The deck features bigger threats than even most Nic Fit variants,
and it's a blast to play while still being among the more competitive Nic Fit variants.
