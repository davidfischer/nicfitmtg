Before 2019 upended many decks in Legacy, Junk Fit (or Abzan Fit) was considered one of the strongest fair Nic Fit decks.
Junk offers a midrange control strategy backed by the most powerful creature removal in the format in {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %}
and a whole host of other utility creatures like {% mtgcardlink Gaddock Teeg %} and {% mtgcardlink Knight of Autumn %}
as well as some interesting top-end threats like {% mtgcardlink Archon of Valor's Reach %}.

{% endmtgdeck %}

While this deck technically is a four color list, it only splashes a single Tropical Island for {% mtgcardlink Leovold, Emissary of Trest | Leovold %}
so it "counts". It packs a full three 5-drops in {% mtgcardlink Titania, Protector of Argoth %}, {% mtgcardlink Thragtusk %}, and {% mtgcardlink Nissa, Vital Force %}
in favor of any 6-drops. The goal of Junk Fit, as with many Nic Fit decks is to use the ramp provided by {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}
to ramp to bigger threats than anything the opponent has.

{% mtgcardlink Containment Priest %} is not usually seen out of Nic Fit sideboards as it shuts off {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %},
{% mtgcardlink Dryad Arbor %} and parts of {% mtgcardlink Meren of Clan Nel Toth %} but in the right matchup, it can be devastating.
Typically Reanimator doesn't pack a solution to the priest outside of discard and Dredge is usually dead to it.
It's a little weaker against the Hogaak decks which were brand new about the time this deck went through the Legacy Challenge.
Some newer white-black decks are testing {% mtgcardlink Kunoros, Hound of Athreos %} although for Junk Fit
that shuts off flashing back {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}.


### Why splash white?

Historically, the biggest reasons for moving from straight Golgari to Abzan
was to get access to {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %}.
White also added some nice top-end threat cards like {% mtgcardlink Archon of Valor's Reach %}, {% mtgcardlink Sigarda, Host of Herons %}, or {% mtgcardlink Dragonlord Dromoka %}
and white has some of the better hate and sideboard cards like {% mtgcardlink Gaddock Teeg %} and {% mtgcardlink Ethersworn Canonist %}.
While Swords is still the best creature removal in the format, a few things have changed over the last couple years.

Firstly, Teeg isn't the silver bullet he once was.
I think Douges at the Green Sun's Zenith [laid out this case](https://greensunszenith.com/gaddock-teeg-in-legacy/) very well
but basically {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %} does almost the same job without needing white
and a lot of great new three drops that get under Teeg have been printed recently.
Secondly, the great green-white top-end threats have mostly been replaced by {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} and {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}.
Sigarda and Archon aren't as good in a format full of {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %}.
Lastly, {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %} is one of the best fair strategies around and many of the creatures Junk previously ran aren't great against Oko.

> **A note on {% mtgcardlink Siege Rhino %}**
>
> Back in 2014 when Siege Rhino was printed, it dominated standard and people tested it in a few other formats.
> Many Junk Fit pilots happily ran the full set of this card.
> Sadly, by 2019 (and even before although some folks didn't want to admit it) this card was completely outclassed by newer threats.
> Cutting the Rhino has resulted in worse Burn matchups but most other matchups are better as a result.


## Sideboarding

{% mtghand %}
Deafening Silence
Gaddock Teeg
Ethersworn Canonist
Kambal, Consul of Allocation
Sanctum Prelate
{% endmtghand %}

White opens a lot of sideboarding options to Nic Fit and that continues to be true even in the Oko meta.
Junk Fit was designed to prey on fair creature decks of the format like Delver, D&T, and Maverick
and it has plenty of removal in the form of {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %} and {% mtgcardlink Abrupt Decay %}.
Between fair decks and Depths decks, Junk usually packs a few extra Swords (or {% mtgcardlink Path to Exile %}) in the sideboard
on top of the 2-3 in the main deck to have some additional answers.
As a result, Junk has a little bit of a better matchup against Depths strategies where it feels closer to 50-50 and favorable matchups against creature decks.

Like most fair, value-oriented decks without counter magic, Junk can struggle against fast combo decks like Storm, Belcher, Show & Tell, or Reanimator
and many of the sideboard slots are dedicated here. Typically 4-6 slots are reserved for graveyard hate like {% mtgcardlink Leyline of the Void %}
or {% mtgcardlink Surgical Extraction %}. 
For the non-graveyard combo decks, white has a lot of extra answers in the form of {% mtgcardlink Deafening Silence %}, {% mtgcardlink Gaddock Teeg %},
or {% mtgcardlink Ethersworn Canonist %} on top of the usual main deck {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %}.
Typically another 3-4 slots are reserved for this.

Very hard control decks like Miracles historically have been a problem for Junk Fit.
Before the banning of {% mtgcardlink Sensei's Divining Top %}, the matchup was extremely tough.
This is certainly less true since the banning and since the printing of {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}.
In the past a few cards in the sideboard like {% mtgcardlink Choke %}, {% mtgcardlink Palace Jailer %},
or even something like {% mtgcardlink Thrun, the Last Troll %} would be dedicated to beating blue decks.


## Variations

### Rectors

{% mtghand %}
Academy Rector
Arena Rector
{% endmtghand %}

There's a whole guide dedicated to [Rectors variants]({% link _pages/archetypes/rectors.md %}) which can range
from all-in on the combo to mostly fair strategies with a backup Rector plan.


### Lands matter

{% mtghand %}
Knight of the Reliquary
Elvish Reclaimer
Crop Rotation
Courser of Kruphix
Ramunap Excavator
Karakas
Titania, Protector of Argoth
{% endmtghand %}

A few intrepid pilots have built Junk decks with a whole heap of utility lands such as {% mtgcardlink Bojuka Bog %},
{% mtgcardlink Karakas %}, {% mtgcardlink Phyrexian Tower %}, {% mtgcardlink Volrath's Stronghold %}, and {% mtgcardlink Nurturing Peatland %}
as well as ways to fetch them out of the deck and retrieve them from the graveyard.
Having access to a very early {% mtgcardlink Crop Rotation %} into Bog or Karakas can give the deck some extra outs
against fast combo decks like Show & Tell or Reanimator or give them grinding power against Loam decks or decks with {% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath | Uro %}.


## Wrapup

In 2020, Junk Fit is in a bit of a tough spot.
There aren't as many good reasons to splash white in fair Nic Fit and Junk's main strategy can struggle against {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns | Oko %}.
White does still provide fantastic removal in {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %} and great sideboard cards like {% mtgcardlink Deafening Silence %},
but it isn't currently as strong as [BUG Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/bug-fit.md %}).
If you want to play Abzan colors in Nic Fit, you may find more success with [Rectors]({% link _pages/archetypes/rectors.md %}).
What that really shows is that many decks are just one to two printings away from irrelevance
or one to two printings away from coming back from irrelevance to the top.
