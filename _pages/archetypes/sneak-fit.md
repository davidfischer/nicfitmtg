Sneak Fit is a Red-Green-Black combo Nic Fit deck that uses the ramp from {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}
to get an early {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %} and cheat very large threats into play
that can win the game on the spot.

This deck's game plan is very similar to the more fair [Jund Nic Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/jund-fit.md %})
except that it includes Sneak Attack and a few creatures to pair with Sneak like {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn | Emrakul %}.
Unlike a more pure-play combo deck like Sneak & Show or Omnitell, it has a reasonable fair backup plan
that can also win the game on its own.

<p class="text-center small mt-2">Yours truly created a deck tech and ran the list above through a MTGO legacy league in August 2020.</p>

This is the post-M21 list I put together although I don't want to say it's an optimal list.
This listed opted for three {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %} instead of four
which results in fewer clunky draws (of which this deck gets its fair share)
although many games you won't even see Sneak Attack and you'll have to rely on the fair game plan.

This list went for a full 24 lands due to the number of utility lands.
Four of the lands don't even generate relevant colors of mana so even with 24 the land situation can be challenging.
{% mtgcardlink Grove of the Burnwillows %} and {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} sort of work against each other
because you want multiple Groves but with Field you want as many different lands as possible.
Even with 24 lands, in the league video embedded above I had a few games where mana was awkward.

I chose to skip the {% mtgcardlink Inferno Titan %} in this list which hasn't felt as necessary
since {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} getting {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} is usually a better six drop.
I played about 30 games with Inferno Titan but never once fetched it out with {% mtgcardlink Fierce Empath %}
and while it was very good sometimes I felt fewer top end threats resulted in better draws.

A few mainboard decisions were made to try to shore up some of the bad matchups notably Depths.
I put in a maindeck {% mtgcardlink Karakas %} with no use for white mana as well as two {% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy | Assassin's Trophies %}
which are all around good but are especially good against Depths.


## How is Sneak Fit played?

Sneak Fit is a combo deck that can play an entirely fair game plan.
Frequently the best course of action is to play for a longer fair game
while having {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %} as a way to win out of nowhere.
The longer the game goes, the more likely you are to win it especially against fair decks.

Unless deck lists are available, most opponents will just put you on Jund Fit rather than Sneak Fit.
Use this to your advantage as people will sideboard incorrectly against you.
Many times you can win a game without showing the combo
and also if you show the combo sometimes it's correct to sideboard out of it.

Once Sneak Attack is on the table, the deck has a lot of ways to end the game.
{% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %} for {% mtgcardlink Fierce Empath %} can get {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn | Emrakul %} to end the game.
{% mtgcardlink Woodland Bellower %} can get Empath and then also Emrakul for another way to get the finisher.
Sneak Attack also opens up some different lines like putting {% mtgcardlink Eternal Witness %} into play to get a card from the graveyard at instant-speed
or putting {% mtgcardlink Reclamation Sage %} into play for some instant-speed removal.

> Play to keep playing and you'll generally win.
> This is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of players who are told over and over and over again to play to win, not play to not lose.

## Card considerations

### Utility lands

{% mtghand %}
Field of the Dead
Karakas
Volrath's Stronghold
Phyrexian Tower
Grove of the Burnwillows
{% endmtghand %}

Sneak Fit frequently runs a large amount of utility lands.
These lands are fantastic when {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} cheats them out on turn 4 or beyond,
but it can result in a little bit of a precarious manabase.

* {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} feels pretty mandatory and many decks can't handle {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} into Field
  especially when there's 2 triggers from Primeval Titan in the same {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %} turn.
* {% mtgcardlink Volrath's Stronghold %} is frequently the other land retrieved with the first {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} trigger.
  The reason for this is that if you sneak Prime Time and get Volrath's Stronghold, you can put Prime Time on top of your deck
  during your next upkeep and sneak it again.
* {% mtgcardlink Grove of the Burnwillows %} helps with the deck's control game plan along with {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %}
  and helps the deck to not die against fast aggro decks like {% mtgcardlink Delver of Secrets // Insectile Aberration | Delver %}.
* {% mtgcardlink Karakas %} is a bit of an odd inclusion since there's no other use for white mana.
  However, depending on your meta, this is one of the best solutions to some decks Sneak Fit can struggle against like Depths.
* {% mtgcardlink Phyrexian Tower %} is often a Nic Fit staple and it can help protect your threats from being exiled
  while also being a sac outlet for {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}.


### Top end threats

{% mtghand %}
Primeval Titan
Inferno Titan
Woodland Bellower
Emrakul, the Aeons Torn
{% endmtghand %}

* {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} is pretty mandatory and can frequently close the game on its own
  when it fetches {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}. Since the deck runs quite a few utility lands,
  Primeval Titan is a fantastic top end threat.
* {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn %} is the other threat which frequently closes the game on a single attack.
  Emrakul is the best creature to sneak off of {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %} as a single attack usually closes the game
  and there's very little instant speed interaction to stop the attack.
  Hardcasting Emrakul off of a {% mtgcardlink Carpet of Flowers %} or two actually comes up against hard control decks like Miracles
  more than you'd think as those matchups tend to go long.
* {% mtgcardlink Woodland Bellower %} is an odd card for a legacy deck, but it works very well here.
  Bellower can close out a game with {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %} by getting {% mtgcardlink Fierce Empath %} into Emrakul for a 21 damage attack.
  Without Sneak Attack, it's still a great value creature and there's a number of three mana creatures to retrieve
  with {% mtgcardlink Tireless Tracker %} being the most common.
  It can also get things like {% mtgcardlink Reclamation Sage %} to clear out problematic permanents like {% mtgcardlink Ensnaring Bridge %}.
* {% mtgcardlink Inferno Titan %} is the other main top end threat worth considering as it can wipe a wide board of threats
  and can close some games that even Primeval Titan or Emrakul can't.


### Card advantage and selection

{% mtghand %}
Village Rites
Tireless Tracker
Sylvan Library
Seasoned Pyromancer
Vraska, Golgari Queen
{% endmtghand %}

This decks relies on drawing combo pieces such as {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %} and {% mtgcardlink Fierce Empath %}
without any blue hand-fixing cantrips.
As a result, it needs a lot of card advantage/selection to make that work.

* {% mtgcardlink Tireless Tracker %} is a very important creature for this deck as it can be found with {% mtgcardlink Woodland Bellower %}
  when the deck is not looking for a combo finish. Tracker also can single-handedly take over a game with massive card advantage
  especially in a deck running this many lands and ways to get them with {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %}.
* Both {% mtgcardlink Vraska, Golgari Queen %} and {% mtgcardlink Village Rites %} provide a sac outlet
  for creatures that are about to die anyway from {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %}.
  Vraska helps a bit more against control matchups where she really shines with her -3 ability that can sometimes get multiple activations.
  Rites, however, is one of the best turn 2 ways of killing your own {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}.
* {% mtgcardlink Seasoned Pyromancer %} is a good card selection engine as you can use it to pitch extra {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %}
  or put {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn | Emrakul %} back in the deck for when she's needed.
  Double red, however, can be a challenge and there's no way to search for Pyromancer out of the deck.


## Sneak Fit matchups

Due to running cards like {% mtgcardlink Punishing Fire %},
Sneak Fit has a pretty good matchup against most aggro decks like Delver.
Frequently, the fair game plan is enough against these types of decks,
and sometimes it's correct to sideboard out the combo in these matchups
and just rely on the consistency of [Jund Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/jund-fit.md %}).
Very fast aggro decks and especially those relying on multiple threats that are resistant to Punishing Fire
such as tribal decks, Eldrazi, or Death's Shadow, are the hardest aggro matchups.

Sneak Fit also has a favorable matchups against most control decks
such as Grixis Midrange, Snow, or Miracles.
Sneak simply has too many must-answer threats in the form of {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %},
{% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %}, and as the game progresses {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %}.
The opponent will run out of countermagic before you run out of threats.
The sideboard also contains a number of cards that are good against control
such as {% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %} and {% mtgcardlink Red Elemental Blast %}.

Like most Nic Fit decks, Sneak Fit struggles a bit against combo decks.
Against decks like Storm, you're typically relying on {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} and {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %}
which is really only a roadblock against them.
Depths decks can be especially hard as there's typically very little pre-board to interact with their game plan.
Often times, that matchup can end up becoming a race and against the faster Depths decks,
that's not a race that is easily won.

One area that is unique for Sneak Fit due to its huge threats such as {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn | Emrakul %}
is that Show and Tell decks like Sneak & Show or Omnitell aren't as bad of pairings as they are for most Nic Fit variants.
Many cards in the deck can be put into play off of {% mtgcardlink Show and Tell %} that will completely destroy the opponent.


## Wrapup

Sneak Fit is a bit better positioned right now than [Jund Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/jund-fit.md %})
as the deck has better control matchups and the combo matchups are probably slightly better as well.
In an event made up of lots of control and aggro decks, this could be a good meta call.
