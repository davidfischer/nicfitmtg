BUG Fit is a fair Green-Black-Blue Nic Fit variant.
While the exact mechanics of the deck can vary a bit, BUG Fit typically has a midrange control plan
with a few bigger threats to such as {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} and planeswalkers such as {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %}.

Before 2019, the main reasons to splash blue in Nic Fit were {% mtgcardlink Leovold, Emissary of Trest %},
{% mtgcardlink Baleful Strix %} and maybe you could make a case for {% mtgcardlink Glen Elendra Archmage %}.
Overall, this archetype was probably one of the weaker fair variants.
Not anymore!
The printing of {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %}, {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %}, and {% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %}
has turned BUG into one of if not the best fair archetypes.
{% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} also gave BUG (and all other Nic Fit variants) one of the best finishers in the format
which was something it lacked in years past.

After the printing of so many great Blue-Green cards in 2019,
it was only a matter of time before Nic Fit brewers had some success with this variant.
While Orim67 wasn't the first BUG Fit 5-0 in a MTGO Legacy League, the deck is a good starting point for future brews
and has a few interesting cards in it.

{% endmtgdeck %}

This is a deck designed for the Oko meta.
The creature curve tops out at 4 with Questing Beast and Meren
but the un-elkable planeswalkers continues to even higher converted mana costs.
It's interesting to see {% mtgcardlink Ashiok, Nightmare Muse %} make what is probably a Legacy debut
and {% mtgcardlink Garruk, Cursed Huntsman %} also seems quite good in the 6 slot.

For a long time {% mtgcardlink Tarmogoyf %} was out of fashion in Nic Fit.
An ideal turn 2 for Nic Fit typically involves flashing back {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} and ramping to something big.
2 drops typically have some sort of utility rather than being a just a vanilla creature like Goyf.
However, with Oko making expensive creatures into elks, lower mana cost creatures start to look a lot better.
Few creatures in the format compete power-wise with Tarmogoyf and none for 2 mana.
Coupled with the discard suite, Tarmogoyf seems like a great card to help hold the board before ramping to bigger threats.

It's surprising not to see {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %} in the main or sideboard,
but perhaps the idea is that between the discard suite and the anti-combo sideboard cards
there's enough for those matchups.
If your meta is a bit combo-heavy, that's definitely a card to consider.

> **A note on {% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %}**
>
> The deck above predates the printing of Uro which should likely be included in most BUG Fit decks.
> The card can help Nic Fit stabilize on life while ramping to bigger threats
> and the escape cost is completely manageable in this deck.


### Why would you run this over BUG Zenith?

BUG Zenith is a strong deck that has put up some decent finishes.
This deck differs from it in a few key ways.
Firstly, this deck runs the {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} / {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} package
over {% mtgcardlink Arcum's Astrolabe %}.
The ramp from Vets gives BUG Fit the ability to cast bigger threats like {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %}
and larger planeswalkers like {% mtgcardlink Garruk, Cursed Huntsman %} or {% mtgcardlink Liliana, Dreadhorde General %}.
Most BUG Zenith decks top out at about 4 mana while this deck frequently goes to 6.
If that sounds more your style, this deck is probably for you.


### Why doesn't BUG Fit run Force of Will?

Most BUG Fit decks don't run {% mtgcardlink Force of Will %}.
Probably the biggest reason is that it's hard to keep the blue count high enough for Force.
To play Force, you probably also want to play {% mtgcardlink Brainstorm %} and possibly {% mtgcardlink Ponder %}
and at that point it's probably a different deck.


## Good and bad matchups for BUG Fit

Decks running Oko have pretty good matchups against anything fair and this deck is no exception.
The deck is built to beat fair aggro decks while having enough grind and top-end to beat many other midrange decks.
The impact of {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %} as well as Oko on fair creature matchups
where the opponent has flying beaters like Death and Taxes and Delver cannot be overstated.
{% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %} has done wonders to help Nic Fit stabilize on life as well.

Most fair Nic Fit decks struggle against decks or the newer Snow Control decks.
However, this deck seems a little better suited to that matchup
by having your own Okos as well as other planeswalkers and Field of the Dead can singlehandedly win that matchup.
The matchup feels close to even which is a huge improvement.

Combo decks continue to be the bane of Nic Fit
and without running {% mtgcardlink Force of Will %} that doesn't change just by adding blue.
Decks like Elves, Storm, and Show & Tell are still very difficult to beat because they come online a little faster than BUG Fit.
Graveyard decks run a game plan that is hard to interact with as well.
Typically most of the sideboard gets devoted to these matchups.


## Sideboarding

{% mtghand %}
Mindbreak Trap
Unmoored Ego
Tyrant's Scorn
Back to Basics
{% endmtghand %}

Blue adds a few interesting options to the usual Nic Fit sideboard staples.
{% mtgcardlink Mindbreak Trap %} is probably one of the best options.
It can result in a blowout win against some combo variants like Storm
where it can counter all the copies of {% mtgcardlink Empty the Warrens %} or {% mtgcardlink Tendrils of Agony %},
but it is also quite hard castable for a deck like Nic Fit.
It's worth noting that since Mindbreak Trap exiles spells,
it gets around cards like Veil of Summer and can even counter things like {% mtgcardlink Abrupt Decay %}.

Unlike similar cards like {% mtgcardlink Lost Legacy %} or {% mtgcardlink Slaughter Games %},
{% mtgcardlink Unmoored Ego %} can name lands to get rid of {% mtgcardlink Dark Depths %},
{% mtgcardlink Thespian's Stage %}, or even {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} if needed.
It is a strict upgrade over Lost Legacy for BUG Fit.

{% mtgcardlink Tyrant's Scorn %} is a removal spell that can deal with {% mtgcardlink Marit Lage %}
and that makes it a pretty good sideboard card in that matchup.
While {% mtgcardlink Abrupt Decay %} is the removal of choice for Nic Fit currently,
Tyrant's Scorn can deal with any creature even if just temporarily.
Most BUG Fit variants don't run {% mtgcardlink Force of Will %}, but if you are,
then Tyrant's Scorn can provide additional cards toward the Blue spell count.

Compared with most decks in the format, Nic Fit runs a lot of basic lands -- typically 5-7 --
and that means {% mtgcardlink Back to Basics %} can be pretty good.
Any deck that doesn't run more than 1-2 basics like Lands, Loam, and Delver can be severely punished.
With the ramp provided by Veteran Explorer, Back to Basics can come down as early as turn 2.
It also provides an out against {% mtgcardlink Cloudpost %} decks which are very hard to beat for any fair Nic Fit deck.


## Wrapup

If you're planning to run a fair Nic Fit deck, BUG is probably where you want to be.
2019 and 2020 added a fair number of extremely powerful Simic cards like {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %}
and {% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %} that are becoming Legacy mainstays in a number of decks
and these cards slot in very well into BUG Nic Fit.
If you want to play with some of the newest and best cards in the format while still playing fair Magic,
this deck is for you.
