{{ site.title | escape }} is a site dedicated to the Magic: the Gathering Legacy deck Nic Fit.
Nic Fit is a flexible, meta-dependent deck that relies on {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} and {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} to ramp into larger threats while presenting a disruption package.
The deck is not always competitive depending on the meta.
More basic lands, more combo decks, and bigger threats make for more challenging matchups for Nic Fit pilots.

The deck as a whole can range from a very fair, value creature based game to unfair combo variants
that attempt to cheat {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn | Emrakul %} into play.
Take a look at the [archetypes page]({% link _pages/archetypes.md %}) for all the different Nic Fit variants.


## History of Nic Fit

There are a number of theories about where the name Nic Fit came from.
While some claim that somebody misspelled Nice Fit and the name Nic Fit stuck,
the name really originates from a Sonic Youth song of same name
according to this [2011 thread on The Source](http://www.mtgthesource.com/forums/showthread.php?20983-Deck-Nic-Fit-(GBx-Explorer-Zenith-Control))
from user Tao who helped pioneer the deck.
