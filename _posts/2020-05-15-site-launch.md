The Legacy community is fantastic and it's truly great that there's enough depth to decks and matchups
to have sites entirely dedicated to a single deck.
The [Nic Fit discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/5R6KBa5) has wanted a site to showcase Nic Fit content
like deck techs, tournament reports, and interviews for a while
and I thought it was worthwhile to use my skills to help put this together.

NicFitMTG.com was heavily influenced by some other successful Legacy content sites including
[GreenSunsZenith.com](https://greensunszenith.com/),
[TheEpicStorm.com](https://www.theepicstorm.com),
and [Thraben University](http://www.thrabenuniversity.com/).
I'd like to thank those and others for paving the way.
