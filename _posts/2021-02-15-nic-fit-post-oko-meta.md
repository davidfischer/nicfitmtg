Today, Wizards of the Coast upended Legacy
by [banning](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/february-15-2021-banned-and-restricted-announcement)
{% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns | Oko %},
{% mtgcardlink Dreadhorde Arcanist %}, and {% mtgcardlink Arcum's Astrolabe %}.
Here, we discuss the possible implications of these bans for Nic Fit.
While you could politely call this post a series of "educated guesses",
more accurately you should describe it as wild speculation
that might all be proven wrong in a few short weeks.

{% mtghand %}
Oko, Thief of Crowns
Dreadhorde Arcanist
Arcum's Astrolabe
{% endmtghand %}


## Who are the winners of this ban?

Threats that cost more than three mana are clear winners from this ban.
Due to how popular Oko was and how it turned any real threat into an Elk
it put a huge damper on what cards were playable.
Cards either had to be cheap so that it wasn't a big loss if they got "elked"
or they had to have already acheived what they were trying to do like {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %}.
A lot more cards just became "Nic Fit playable" today.

{% mtghand %}
Elder Gargaroth
Birthing Pod
Sigarda, Host of Herons
Archon of Valor's Reach
Assassin's Trophy
{% endmtghand %}

In the [article outlining Nic Fit playables in M21]({% link _posts/2020-06-16-m21-cards-for-nic-fit.md %}),
I doubted that {% mtgcardlink Elder Gargaroth %} would see any play mostly due to Oko
and I was right for the most part.
This ban throws all that out the window and going forward,
I expect it to be among the best five drops for Nic Fit
along with {% mtgcardlink Titania, Protector of Argoth | Titania %}.
Gargaroth will be almost impossible for decks like Delver to beat
and it generates recurring tokens, lifegain, and card advantage all on a non-legendary body.

{% mtgcardlink Birthing Pod %} has also been in a bad spot for a while because it is a situational card
-- requiring a creature in play -- and most opponents know to elk it immediately.
Without Oko, Pod gets a lot better.
Being immune to {% mtgcardlink Abrupt Decay %} makes it a challenge to deal with using common removal from Legacy
and while I expect an uptick in {% mtgcardlink Kolaghan's Command %},
many decks won't have a good way to remove Pod.
Pod is particularly good in decks running {% mtgcardlink Yorion, Sky Nomad %}
as it allows you to run even more silver bullets (or a combo finish) with the larger deck size.

Overall, some of the top end threats in [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %})
like {% mtgcardlink Sigarda, Host of Herons %} and {% mtgcardlink Archon of Valor's Reach %}
get better with this ban. Both were considerations before the printing of {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %}
made them bad and it's likely we'll be seeing less of that snake in Legacy.
As a result, I expect Junk Fit overall and many of its top-end threats specifically
will be better relatively with these bans.

I think it's worth mentioning that {% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %} will get a boost from this ban
for a few reasons. Firstly, opposing mana bases will likely rely a bit less on basics going forward
without {% mtgcardlink Arcum's Astrolabe %} which will limit Trophy's downside.
Secondly, because of the necessity of dealing immediately with {% mtgcardlink Dreadhorde Arcanist %} and Oko
or being buried in card advantage, {% mtgcardlink Abrupt Decay %} was usually the preferred removal.
Going forward, I expect Nic Fit pilots will go with a mix of Decay and Trophy.


## Who are the losers from the ban?

While [BUG Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/bug-fit.md %})
is definitely weaker with the ban, it's not clear whether the deck will be weaker relatively in the meta.
BUG Fit will be one of very few decks in Legacy that can slot in {% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %}
and cast it entirely off of basic lands.
While it won't have access to {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %} any longer,
Uro is still a game-winning threat that is hard to deal with permanently.
While Oko was legal, BUG was definitely the best fair Nic Fit variant.
Now it's unclear what will be best but BUG, [Abzan]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}),
[Jund]({% link _pages/archetypes/jund-fit.md %}), and even straight green-black
all have good reasons to pilot them.

In the wider meta, these bans took aim at two decks that have been dominant in Legacy: RUG Delver and Snowko.
Historically, Delver decks were a favorable matchup for Nic Fit.
Nic Fit has a basic heavy mana base with threats that outclass Delver
if we can survive the early game.
More recently, with how finely tuned the modern RUG lists became and the card advantage
offered by Oko and {% mtgcardlink Dreadhorde Arcanist %},
these matchups have been closer to even or even Delver favored.
These bans will greatly improve the Delver matchup
regardless of whether Delver becomes straight blue-red, Grixis, or something else entirely.

Snowko decks are harder to assess because it seems likely the deck will go away entirely.
It will be folded back into Miracles which will probably stick with a stable blue-white mana base.
During the {% mtgcardlink Sensei's Divining Top %} era,
Miracles was a borderline unwinnable matchup for fair Nic Fit
but there are a lot more tools to fight it now from {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %},
{% mtgcardlink Klothys, God of Destiny %}, or {% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %}.
Any Nic Fit deck with {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} and Field
is probably at least slightly favored against Miracles.


## Nic Fit's position in the meta

There's a lot of moving pieces to say whether Nic Fit will be any good going forward.
It is just one deck and how playable it is depends a lot
on which other decks see larger shares of play as a result of this shake-up.
Combo decks, usually bad matchups for  Nic Fit,
are mostly unaffected by these bans and their meta share could go up limiting what Nic Fit pilots can do.
However, these bans also improve hatebear decks like Maverick and Death & Taxes
which are both typically good matchups.

However, a few things are certain from these bans:

* We are going to see fewer basic lands on the other side of the table in the post-Astrolabe meta.
  This is undoubtedly good for Nic Fit
  as we want the ramp provided by {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} to be as one-sided as possible.
* Two mana repeatable card advantage engines will have some sort of drawback
  whether in the form of deckbuilding restrictions like {% mtgcardlink Dark Confidant %}
  or life loss like {% mtgcardlink Sylvan Library %}.
  Combo decks might kill you turn two but having uncounterable removal
  available that turn will be less critical most of the time.
* There will be debate again about what the best three mana planeswalker will be in the format.
  {% mtgcardlink Liliana of the Veil %} will probably come back in a big way
  but {% mtgcardlink Teferi, Time Raveler %}
  and {% mtgcardlink Dack Fayden %} will see their fair share of play.
  Maybe we'll even see planeswalkers that cost more than three mana.

The meta is more wide open than its been in a while
and Nic Fit as well positioned as its been for some time.
Happy brewing!
