This set has a few especially hard to evaluate cards in it
and so I did something a bit different for this [set overview]({% link _categories/setoverview.md %}).
I added a section for cards for "future consideration".
These cards don't seem to fit into current Legacy Nic Fit but a few of them might be brewed into new archetypes
or putting a new spin on an existing deck.
While this is me hedging my bets a bit and it's hard to really evaluate cards before seeing them in action,
I think this set has more of those kinds of cards than normal.

Here's the cards I think are most relevant to Legacy Nic Fit.


## Playable

{% mtghand large %}
Agadeem's Awakening // Agadeem, the Undercrypt
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Agadeem's Awakening // Agadeem, the Undercrypt | Agadeem's Awakening %} is a powerful late game value engine
that takes up a land slot (or perhaps half a land slot and half a spell slot).
It is extremely flexible in that it can be a land if needed,
it can enter untapped at a cost or tapped if it's not needed immediately,
but late game it can be used to get a three or more for one.
Triple black is quite an investment but isn't too hard in Nic Fit by the time
there are 6+ lands in play which is when you actually want to cast this spell.

Combined with Nic Fit staples like {% mtgcardlink Eternal Witness %},
this can be cast multiple times to generate very large amounts of value.
{% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} has shown the power of threats
that only require a land slot and while this card isn't quite the power level of Field,
I expect some pilots will definitely include it.


{% mtghand large %}
Yasharn, Implacable Earth
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Yasharn, Implacable Earth %} is not perfect for Nic Fit.
It turns off flashing back our own {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %} and it disables our fetchlands.
However, turning off fetchlands isn't as critical by the time you can get a four-drop into play
especially when that four drop gives you two more lands.
Likewise, Cabal Therapy isn't as important by the time you're casting Yasharn.

Yasharn hits a **ton** of other relevant Legacy cards besides fetchlands including:

* {% mtgcardlink Surgical Extraction %} (requires hardcasting)
* {% mtgcardlink Force of Will %} (requires hardcasting)
* Clue tokens (usually that hits Nic Fit too)
* Food tokens
* {% mtgcardlink Lotus Petal %}
* {% mtgcardlink Lion's Eye Diamond %}
* {% mtgcardlink Food Chain %}
* {% mtgcardlink Cavern Harpy %} (activated ability)
* {% mtgcardlink Griselbrand %} (activated ability)
* {% mtgcardlink Village Rites %}
* Canopy land mana abilities
* quite a few relevant Goblins
* {% mtgcardlink Toxic Deluge %}
* {% mtgcardlink Natural Order %} (unless sacrificing {% mtgcardlink Dryad Arbor %})
* {% mtgcardlink Altar of Dementia %}
* {% mtgcardlink Carrion Feeder %}
* {% mtgcardlink Retrofitter Foundry %} (most modes)
* {% mtgcardlink Pernicious Deed %}
* {% mtgcardlink Vampire Hexmage %}
* {% mtgcardlink Dismember %} (requires hardcasting)
* {% mtgcardlink Urza's Bauble %} and {% mtgcardlink Mishra's Bauble %}
* {% mtgcardlink Phyrexian Tower %} (sacrifice ability)

While this card is probably a better fit overall for a deck like Sylvan Plug,
I think this will appear in some Nic Fit lists as a potent four-drop lock piece.


{% mtghand large %}
Sea Gate Stormcaller 
{% endmtghand %}

Even though {% mtgcardlink Sea Gate Stormcaller %} is sort of an odd card,
it enables some interesting plays like turn one {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}
into turn two Stormcaller with double Therapy.
I want to evaluate this card in a similar way to {% mtgcardlink Spellseeker %}
which sees occasional play in Nic Fit lists but I think Stormcaller has a slightly higher ceiling
because of the upside of it having a better body, a possibly relevant kicker,
and a lower casting cost.
It won't make every [BUG Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/bug-fit.md %}) list
but I won't be surprised when I see it.


> **Update**
>
> After posting this article, a few people convinced me that
> {% mtgcardlink Felidar Retreat %} might be good enough to merit a mention.
> Initially, I had pinned this new Retreat as a worse {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}
> that couldn't be found with {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %}.
> However, it has a few things going for it.
> It is hard to remove, it makes {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} a threat in all phases of the game,
> it is good in multiples, and it combines nicely with Field itself.
> It seems worth testing in a [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}) / lands matter deck.


## Possible for future consideration

{% mtghand large %}
Valakut Exploration
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Valakut Exploration %} is a very interesting and strange card.
It doubles as a card advantage engine and a slow clock on the opponent.
It has clear synergy with {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} and
it's a sort of alternative to {% mtgcardlink Sylvan Library %} and {% mtgcardlink Tireless Tracker %}.
I think it's a good card against control decks like Snow Control or Miracles
but it might not be better for fair [Jund Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/jund-fit.md %})
in those matchups than {% mtgcardlink Klothys, God of Destiny %}.
As long as {% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath | Uro %} is so popular, Klothys will be pretty good.
Some [Scapewish]({% link _pages/archetypes/scapewish.md %}) pilots might try this out as a one- or two-of
although it's awkward if you bin your {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} or {% mtgcardlink Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle %}.
This card merits some play-testing but it might just be a better card in a deck like Burn or Lands.


{% mtghand large %}
Shadows' Verdict
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Shadows' Verdict %} is very mana-intensive for a card that might just be countered.
However, it is a clean answer to many of the format's recent fair threats as it solves
{% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %} and {% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %} cleanly.
It also could be a one-sided board wipe since many Nic Fit sized threats can be bigger than three CMC.
I view this as an alternative to {% mtgcardlink Pernicious Deed %} that solves 2019-2020 problems.

Where I don't like Shadows' Verdict is that many fair Nic Fit decks were already trending toward cheaper curves
with cards like {% mtgcardlink Tarmogoyf %} coming back and playing our own Okos and Uros being strong plays.
I don't think this is a maindeck card, but I could see this showing up in some sideboards for Uro and Oko matchups.


{% mtghand large %}
Soul Shatter
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Soul Shatter %} isn't amazing but I think it's worth a look
if you were already considering something like {% mtgcardlink To the Slaughter %}.
In a format with {% mtgcardlink Veil of Summer %}, not targeting has its perks.


{% mtghand large %}
Confounding Conundrum
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Confounding Conundrum %} is interesting as a way to mitigate the opponent's
benefits from {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %} ramp.
It has the added benefit of significantly weakening opposing fetchlands especially when it comes out on curve on the play.
I will admit that this card is a bit hard to evaluate but I don't think it's a fit in the current Nic Fit game plan.
Perhaps some future combo variant could use this card.


{% mtghand large %}
Nissa of Shadowed Boughs
{% endmtghand %}

The new Green-Black {% mtgcardlink Nissa of Shadowed Boughs %} is a pretty strong planeswalker for four mana
and has obvious synergy with the Nic Fit game plan.
Nissa's -5 is very attainable, doesn't target, and can retrieve big threats from the graveyard without being dead to {% mtgcardlink Leyline of the Void %}.
Menace on her +1 really improves the ability as well.
What I don't like is that she doesn't protect herself very well and doesn't have enough impact on the board immediately when played on curve.
I think that the current planeswalker options like {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %} and {% mtgcardlink Vraska, Golgari Queen %}
are better than this Nissa but if the format changes a bit I could see Nissa being a decent alternative.


{% mtghand large %}
Scute Swarm
{% endmtghand %}

In a format where {% mtgcardlink Plague Engineer %} is pretty common,
{% mtgcardlink Scute Swarm %} doesn't look great compared with other comparable three drops
like {% mtgcardlink Tireless Tracker %}.
However, Scute Swarm has obvious synergy with {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer %}
and go-wide strategies sort of ebb and flow based on the number of sweepers in the format.
This isn't a fit in 2020 Legacy, but might be worth looking at in the future.


## Not quite a fit

{% mtghand large %}
Cragplate Baloth
{% endmtghand %}

Hasty beaters that are {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %} targets are always interesting
and being uncounterable and hexproof is very nice.
At 7 CMC, this is very pricey and it dies without making an impact against {% mtgcardlink Baleful Strix %}
or {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %}.
I think *a lot* would have to change in the format for this to make more sense than {% mtgcardlink Questing Beast %}.


{% mtghand large %}
Turntimber Symbiosis // Turntimber, Serpentine Wood
Sea Gate Restoration // Sea Gate, Reborn
Emeria's Call // Emeria, Shattered Skyclave
Shatterskull Smashing // Shatterskull, the Hammer Pass
{% endmtghand %}

All the bolt-lands (what are we calling these?) are interesting to Nic Fit
as the options can be very relevant late game.
However, none of these have quite the impact or synergy with our existing game plan as {% mtgcardlink Agadeem's Awakening // Agadeem, the Undercrypt | Agadeem's Awakening %}.


{% mtghand large %}
Nighthawk Scavenger
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Nighthawk Scavenger %} is the unholy combination of {% mtgcardlink Tarmogoyf %} and {% mtgcardlink Vampire Nighthawk %}
and seems very powerful on paper. However, for a few reasons I don't think it'll see play in Legacy Nic Fit.
Goyf looks at both graveyards while this only looks at your opponents'.
You don't have as much control over your opponent's graveyard as your own and this means you can't also play {% mtgcardlink Leyline of the Void %}
which is a very common Nic Fit sideboard card.
Secondly, a three drop that doesn't do anything until the next turn seems like a pretty weak play in current Legacy with {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %}.
Lastly, with {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %} being so ubiquitous, I think the value of this card when it does stick is still pretty questionable.


{% mtghand large %}
Ancient Greenwarden
{% endmtghand %}

A powered-up {% mtgcardlink Ramunap Excavator %} that doubles your {% mtgcardlink Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle %}, {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %},
and {% mtgcardlink Tireless Tracker %} triggers isn't bad.
However, as long as {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} is around, that seems like a much better card for your mana than {% mtgcardlink Ancient Greenwarden %}.


## Conclusion

There are a few cards for Legacy Nic Fit in Zendikar Rising
but none seem to fit better into our existing plans than {% mtgcardlink Agadeem's Awakening // Agadeem, the Undercrypt | Agadeem's Awakening %}.
In addition, there are some cards in this set which are very different from existing options
and might allow the creation of entirely new archetypes or taking a deck in a different direction.
Specifically, I'm thinking of things like {% mtgcardlink Valakut Exploration %} or {% mtgcardlink Confounding Conundrum %}.
Overall, this set has cards I'm interested to try in Legacy but nothing that seems absolutely broken which is nice to see.
