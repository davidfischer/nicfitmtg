Unlike the last few sets, Modern Horizons 2 looks like it should have a significant impact on Legacy.
It's almost impossible to assess power level in a vacuum but there are definitely some cards
that will see a ton of play and even some that may drastically change the format.

Here, I'm going to discuss the most impactful cards for Nic Fit
and briefly mention how some cards we might face on the opposing side of the table
might impact our deck building.


## Nic Fit playables


{% mtghand large %}
Grist, the Hunger Tide
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Grist, the Hunger Tide %} is a card I expect will see Legacy play
in many if not most green-black decks that have {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %}
(which can search up Grist).
However, unlike other Legacy decks that will probably run Grist like Abzan Maverick or BUG Zenith,
Nic Fit seems uniquely poised to take advantage of the new insect planeswalker.

For starters, Grist is the best sac outlet that can be found with Zenith
which is especially important for ramping with our own {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer | Veteran Explorers %}.
Grist makes all our Zeniths into removal which has been a problem for Nic Fit in the past.
Lastly, with a combination of Grist's +1 and -2, it should be able to close out the game
against many non-combo decks and the ultimate isn't completely dead text.

{% mtgcardlink Klothys, God of Destiny | Klothys %} has shown the power of a Zenithable card
that doesn't die to board wipes. Grist may die more easily than Klothys but I still expect a big impact.
Grist gets around the {% mtgcardlink Thalia, Guardian of Thraben | Thalia %} tax,
can be brought to {% mtgcardlink Show and Tell %} (and kill an opposing Emrakul),
and can be returned with cards like {% mtgcardlink Meren of Clan Nel Toth %}.
It seems like a fantastic printing for Legacy Nic Fit and I'm excited to try it.

One thing I was excited about with Grist was that I thought it would get around {% mtgcardlink Containment Priest %}.
There is [some debate about this](https://twitter.com/templeofdeceit/status/1400515351205478402)
and I expect the ruling to be firmed up soon.
I'm no judge and this is beyond my ability to say how it works.


{% mtghand large %}
Endurance
Grief
Solitude
{% endmtghand %}

A few of the new evoke elementals cycle are very interesting but I'll focus on {% mtgcardlink Endurance %}
which I think will have the biggest impact on deckbuilding.
Endurance patches up a few weaknesses that Nic Fit has from blocking {% mtgcardlink Delver of Secrets // Insectile Aberration | Delver %}
to being an out against the new {% mtgcardlink Thassa's Oracle %} decks like Doomsday or Oops All Spells
(which are both pretty unfavorable matchups).
An open question is how hard should we lean into Endurance?
Should it be a singleton Zenith target or should it replace {% mtgcardlink Leyline of the Void %} in the sideboard?
Should we run a split in the main and sideboard?
I think the case could be made for the full four Endurances possibly with one or two in the main
but only testing will tell.

While I don't think many Nic Fit decks will adopt {% mtgcardlink Grief %} or {% mtgcardlink Solitude %},
they are worth mentioning.
I could see [Rector decks]({% link _pages/archetypes/rectors.md %})
adopting them in a {% mtgcardlink Living Wish | wishboard %} or possibly in decks that can really abuse
enter the battlefield triggers.
Generally, Nic Fit decks run enough green cards to support Endurance,
but usually not enough black or white cards to support Grief or Solitude.


{% mtghand large %}
Prismatic Ending
Sudden Edict
{% endmtghand %}

While I don't think {% mtgcardlink Prismatic Ending %} or {% mtgcardlink Sudden Edict %}
will replace the usual Nic Fit removal suite, they are worth a mention as possible sideboard cards.
Unless you're running multiple Liliana planeswalkers,
Sudden Edict seems like a decent upgrade on {% mtgcardlink Liliana's Triumph %}.
Especially against the fast Delver decks, having uncounterable removal is a big plus.
I expect most Nic Fit sideboards running Triumph will swap for Sudden Edict.

Prismatic Ending is probably less likely to see play in Nic Fit
especially since [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %})
usually doesn't run the full compliment of {% mtgcardlink Swords to Plowshares %}
and I doubt many people want Prismatic Ending before Swords to Plowshares.
However, Prismatic Ending can take out a problematic small permanent like a {% mtgcardlink Chalice of the Void %}
and could be better than {% mtgcardlink Path to Exile %} for decks already running four Swords.


{% mtghand large %}
Archon of Cruelty
{% endmtghand %}

I don't expect many Nic Fit decks to adopt {% mtgcardlink Archon of Cruelty %}
as eight mana is a lot even for Nic Fit.
However, it's worth a mention for [Sneak Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/sneak-fit.md %})
possibly as a replacement for {% mtgcardlink Inferno Titan %}.
Combined with {% mtgcardlink Sneak Attack %}, the new Archon generates card advantage,
deals with problematic creatures and causes a huge swing in life totals.
It seems like a decent upgrade for that deck.



## Perhaps not even playable in Nic Fit

{% mtghand large %}
Priest of Fell Rites
Dauthi Voidwalker
Thrasta, Tempest's Roar
{% endmtghand %}

While cards playable in Nic Fit is a bit of a meme,
some cards aren't playable even for us.

While {% mtgcardlink Priest of Fell Rites %} seems pretty powerful,
I'm not sure it brings enough to the table to be playable.
Despite being {% mtgcardlink Unburial Rites %} on a creature,
that wasn't usually an effect we wanted.

{% mtgcardlink Dauthi Voidwalker %} is a card I expect will find somewhat of a home
but I don't think Nic Fit is the right deck.
The card can be absolutely nuts and turn a discard effect like {% mtgcardlink Thoughtseize %}
into something akin to {% mtgcardlink Bribery %}.
However, double black is a stretch on turn two
and you're sort of caught between wanting to attack or use the Voidwalkers sacrifice ability.
Exiling cards is particularly strong right now with the Thassa's Oracle decks,
but I think Endurance is the card we want, not this one.
Maybe this will be a fit in Dead Guy.

Big dumb green creatures like {% mtgcardlink Thrasta, Tempest's Roar %}
are usually the domain of Nic Fit but I don't think it's a fit for us.
Firstly, it would be a very expensive Zenith to find it
but secondly, Nic Fit doesn't run as many cheap spells as other decks.
Unless you're playing it after flashing back Cabal Therapy on Veteran Explorer,
it will probably just stay in your hand.


## Cards to watch out for

{% mtghand large %}
Dragon's Rage Channeler
Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer
Kaldra Compleat
{% endmtghand %}

Both {% mtgcardlink Dragon's Rage Channeler %} and {% mtgcardlink Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer %}
could see play in fast tempo decks like Delver.
While Veteran Explorer blocks either one on turn two,
these could represent a slightly faster meta which could force us to make a shift in deckbuilding.
If these become extremely common, it's possible we'll adopt more {% mtgcardlink Fatal Push | Fatal Pushes %}
or other turn one plays as a possible answer.
Nic Fit is definitely susceptible to being beaten by fast tempo decks and we may need to adjust.

A new, larger {% mtgcardlink Batterskull %} in {% mtgcardlink Kaldra Compleat %}
could pose a problem even though I don't think that many decks will adopt it.
It'll probably only see play in decks with the full four {% mtgcardlink Stoneforge Mystic | Stoneforge Mystics %}
because of the high cost of this new living weapon.
I wanted to mention it because it's a creature that is extremely hard to deal with
and actually outclasses Nic Fit sized creatures.
Nothing we run blocks Kaldra Compleat profitably and except for white Nic Fit decks,
we usually don't run many answers to it because both it and the token are indestructible.
We can't even buy much time blocking with tokens or explorers because it tramples.


## Wrapping up

Overall, I'm excited to try some of the new cards
and I expect both {% mtgcardlink Grist, the Hunger Tide %} and {% mtgcardlink Endurance %}
will make a significant impact on Nic Fit and on deckbuilding.

The wider meta gives us some hope but also should make us cautious.
While Delver is usually a good matchup for us,
faster Delver decks powered by
{% mtgcardlink Dragon's Rage Channeler %} and {% mtgcardlink Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer %}
could cause the matchup to swing from favorable back toward problematic as it was in the Oko meta.
Only playtesting will tell but if Nic Fit still has a good matchup against Delver
then it should be reasonably well positioned in the wider meta
especially with the upgrade Endurance should provide against some of the combo matchups.
