featured_card:  "Kaya the Inexorable"

At the risk of looking foolish in a few weeks or months,
it's nice to get a set that doesn't look like it will completely change the meta.
Kaldheim seems like more of a return to sets of years past where there's a few cards that decks will adopt
but nothing seems like it's going to drastically shake up Legacy (hopefully upcoming bans do that!).

Without further ado, these are the cards I think are most relevant to Legacy Nic Fit.

## Worth a look

{% mtghand large %}
Kaya the Inexorable
{% endmtghand %}

While [Junk Fit]({% link _pages/archetypes/junk-fit.md %}) isn't seeing a lot of play lately,
{% mtgcardlink Kaya the Inexorable %} looks like a card worth considering in those colors.
Kaya's +1 ability fits very well with Nic Fit's usual value engines and ticking up to six loyalty
can be pretty powerful as we've seen with certain other walkers.
Exiling a permanent is obviously also quite good.
Her ultimate will usually be popped as soon as it's available since it can be used to re-cast Kaya the next turn.
In a deck that runs quite a few higher CMC legends, it seems great.

[Rector decks]({% link _pages/archetypes/rectors.md %}) may also adopt the new Kaya,
but it's worth mentioning that if a Rector is exiled with its ability,
the ghostform counter will not let you also return it to your hand.
Nonetheless, it is an on-color, fairly castable walker that can exile most problematic permanents (eg. {% mtgcardlink Leyline of the Void %})
while still threatening to take over the game on its own.
It definitely won't replace {% mtgcardlink Ugin, the Spirit Dragon %},
but in more fair oriented {% mtgcardlink Arena Rector %} lists, it's worth considering in addition to Ugin.


{% mtghand large %}
Valki, God of Lies // Tibalt, Cosmic Impostor
{% endmtghand %}

A lot of folks are looking at Valki and Tibalt as a combo with the cascade mechanic.
This will allow casting the Tibalt side even off of something like {% mtgcardlink Shardless Agent %}.
Nic Fit decks, on the other hand, may just want the option to cast Valki which is good on its own as it will help future {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy | Therapies %} or can temporarily deal with a problematic creature.
In games that go long, Nic Fit will have the lands needed to cast Tibalt as a finisher.
Having these kinds of cards that can be played early or scale into the late game a big reason to play Nic Fit.
I think [Jund lists]({% link _pages/archetypes/jund-fit.md %}) will definitely give Valki and Tibalt a try.


{% mtghand large %}
Sarulf, Realm Eater
{% endmtghand %}

While {% mtgcardlink Sarulf, Realm Eater %} suffers from the usual problems (its just an elk with no ETB ability),
some Nic Fit pilots will adopt this card.
Sarulf is similar in many respects to {% mtgcardlink Pernicious Deed %}, a card that sees play in some Nic Fit lists.
This can be used to clear the board of small permanents or tokens
and being {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith | Zenithable %} makes it pretty low cost to include.
Notably, it exiles other permanents so it can't be used to kill your own {% mtgcardlink Veteran Explorer | Vets %}
but it can deal with {% mtgcardlink Marit Lage %} assuming you have a blocker
or {% mtgcardlink Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath %}.

{% mtghand large %}
Mystic Reflection
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Mystic Reflection %} is a tough card to evaluate.
On one hand, it requires a bit of setup but on the other hand it is an answer to most creature-based combo decks in the format.
It single-handedly deals with {% mtgcardlink Thassa's Oracle %} or {% mtgcardlink Emrakul, the Aeons Torn %}
or it can be used to duplicate any creature with an ETB ability.
In a perfect scenario, your {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} can find {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}.
By casting this with Field triggers on the stack, you can make additional Titans to get even more lands.
I'm not sure it'll end up being a fit, but I expect some people to try this card.


## Not quite enough to see action

{% mtghand large %}
Ravenform
{% endmtghand %}

{% mtgcardlink Ravenform %} seems like a good card overall although it's a bit of a color pie bend.
It gives blue the ability to permanently deal with creatures and artifacts which it hasn't had in the past.
However, given that Nic Fit would pair blue with green and black which allow for {% mtgcardlink Abrupt Decay %}
and {% mtgcardlink Assassin's Trophy %}, I don't think it's adding much to our archetype.


{% mtghand large %}
In Search of Greatness
{% endmtghand %}

Since the banning of {% mtgcardlink Sensei's Divining Top %},
Nic Fit has been on the lookout for something to help with card selection and drawing.
However, {% mtgcardlink In Search of Greatness %} isn't the new answer.
The converted mana costs just vary too much in Nic Fit
and it doesn't seem likely that this card will result in more than one or at most two free spells in a game.
I think most decks will stick with {% mtgcardlink Sylvan Library %} which is easier to cast and seems better overall.


{% mtghand large %}
Eradicator Valkyrie
{% endmtghand %}

This card is pretty close actually and if it was a 3/4 instead of a 4/3, I think some decks would try it.
Being flying, lifelink, and protection from pesky planeswalkers like {% mtgcardlink Oko, Thief of Crowns %}
or {% mtgcardlink Teferi, Time Raveler %} seems great. It has a relevant Boast ability to boot!
Nic Fit decks can sometimes struggle to stabilize against Delver decks
and being out of {% mtgcardlink Lightning Bolt | bolt %} range
with the ability to block a {% mtgcardlink Delver of Secrets // Insectile Aberration | Delver %} would be a big deal.
As it is, in the matchups where you really want this, you'll just trade 4 mana for a 1 mana bolt.

{% mtghand large %}
Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider
Battle Mammoth
{% endmtghand %}

Neither of the big green beaters seem quite good enough for the current meta.
While hasty {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith | Zenithable %} creatures 
like {% mtgcardlink Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider %} shouldn't be ignored,
I think it isn't quite as good as {% mtgcardlink Questing Beast %}.
Vorinclex has the same downside of being legendary (and thus vulnerable to {% mtgcardlink Karakas %})
and it's pretty rare you'll want the extra power for more mana.
Likewise, Foretell seems like an interesting mechanic but I don't think a 5 mana creature
that doesn't do anything when it enters the battlefield is quite where we want to be.
{% mtgcardlink Battle Mammoth %} seems worse than {% mtgcardlink Elder Gargaroth %} which sees virtually no play.

{% mtghand large %}
Pyre of Heroes
{% endmtghand %}

Creature types in Nic Fit are pretty varied and as a result, this seems worse than {% mtgcardlink Birthing Pod %}
which isn't exactly seeing a lot of play.
Also, being vulnerable to {% mtgcardlink Abrupt Decay %} is a definite downside.


## Cards to watch out for

This is a new section for this set but I wanted to feature some cards
you might not want to see on the opposing side of the table.

{% mtghand large %}
Weathered Runestone
{% endmtghand %}

In {% mtgcardlink Weathered Runestone %},
Wizards decided to print a new alternative to {% mtgcardlink Grafdigger's Cage %}.
While I don't think this card will be super common,
this will give {% mtgcardlink Chalice of the Void | Chalice %} decks an option with a friendlier CMC.
It also might be part of a {% mtgcardlink Karn, the Great Creator | Karn %} wishboard.
Weathered Runestone works a little differently than the original Cage.
Notably, it stops [Rectors]({% link _pages/archetypes/rectors.md %}) from doing their thing
but it does not stop fetching {% mtgcardlink Dryad Arbor %}.
Like Cage before it, it will still prevent flashing back {% mtgcardlink Cabal Therapy %}
and getting anything with {% mtgcardlink Green Sun's Zenith %}.
