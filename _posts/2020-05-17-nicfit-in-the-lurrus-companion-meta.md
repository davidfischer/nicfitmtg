In the current companion meta, it feels a little silly to leave home without a companion of your own.
For Nic Fit, that companion might just be {% mtgcardlink Yorion, Sky Nomad %}.

User solnox on MTGO took this 100 card deck effectionately titled Yorion EDH Fit to a 5-0 finish in a Legacy league.

According to solnox, the deck has good matchups against aggro and most control matchups including Miracles and Snow Control.
However, the deck suffers against combo decks especially Show & Tell. The latter is not a surprise as most Nic Fit decks struggle there.

I love the {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} with double {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} tech as a finisher for the deck.
4 {% mtgcardlink Baleful Strix %}, 4 {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %}, 4 {% mtgcardlink Arcum's Astrolabe %},
and 2 {% mtgcardlink Abundant Growth %} gives a plethora of things to flicker with Yorion to draw massive amounts of cards.
It's also pretty sick that a 4 color deck can run {% mtgcardlink Back to Basics %}.

Congrats to solnox and while there will probably be a big shift in the meta tomorrow with a Legacy ban & restricted announcement,
it's cool to see Nic Fit grabbing a 5-0 in such a fast meta.
