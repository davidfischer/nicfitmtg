In the current companion meta, it feels a little silly to leave home without a companion of your own.
While for many decks, that companion is {% mtgcardlink Lurrus of the Dream-Den %},
for Nic Fit, that companion might just be {% mtgcardlink Yorion, Sky Nomad %}.

Yorion's deck building requirement to use it as a companion requires that your deck have 20 or more cards than the minimum deck size.
Having more than the minimum is usually a disadvantage as it makes it less likely to draw your good cards.
However, there are some perks in making your deck larger.
A larger deck makes it less likely you'll draw your searchable silver bullets
like {% mtgcardlink Collector Ouphe %}, {% mtgcardlink Thragtusk %}, and {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %}
that you only want to find when you need them.

Yorion also provides a lot of synergy with any permanents with *Enters the Battlefield* effects like
{% mtgcardlink Arcum's Astrolabe %}, {% mtgcardlink Reclamation Sage %}, and {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %}.
It can also be used to reset the loyalty of planeswalkers although not to use them twice in a turn.

User solnox on MTGO took this 100 card deck affectionately titled Yorion EDH Fit to a 5-0 finish in a Legacy league.
Why stop at an 80 card deck when you can meme on Nic Fit being like EDH for Legacy?

According to solnox, the deck has good matchups against aggro and most control matchups including Miracles and Snow Control,
but the deck suffers against combo decks especially Show & Tell.
Struggling against combo is not a surprise as most Nic Fit decks aren't so good there,
but it's even harder to find silver bullets quickly in a 100 card deck.

I love the {% mtgcardlink Primeval Titan %} with double {% mtgcardlink Field of the Dead %} tech as a finisher for the deck.
4 {% mtgcardlink Baleful Strix %}, 4 {% mtgcardlink Ice-Fang Coatl %}, 4 {% mtgcardlink Arcum's Astrolabe %},
and 2 {% mtgcardlink Abundant Growth %} gives a plethora of things to flicker with Yorion to bury opponents in card advantage.
It's also pretty sick that a 4 color deck can run {% mtgcardlink Back to Basics %}.

Congrats to solnox and while there will probably be a big shift in the meta tomorrow with a Legacy ban & restricted announcement,
it's cool to see Nic Fit grabbing a 5-0 in such a fast meta.
